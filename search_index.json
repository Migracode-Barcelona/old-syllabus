Pay\nparticular attention to the technologies we'll be teaching you (JavaScript,\nReact, NodeJS)\n\n\nHouse Rules\nHow we work?\nHow we treat each other?\n\n\nStandup\n\nWelcome!\nWelcome to MigraCode and to the world of Web Development! Now that you have\nbuilt a website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to\nlearn about the tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools\nwill be used during the course, so it is important that you become familiarised\nwith them.\nIn order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task at home:\nmove your CodePen website to a web address under\nhttps://your-username.github.io/your-site-name.\nIn the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website,\nin a location where other developers can make changes to it and view a history\nof all the updates that you have made.\nIf you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting\nbelow, please read the rest of this document.\nAnd remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any\npoint, please ask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the\nlesson, and will explain them in more detail.\nHow to move your website to Github.io\n\nExport your website as a zip from CodePen.\nHelp >\nExtract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer. Keep note\nof the location of this folder.\nRead about the terminal.\nRead about git.\nInstall Git.\nPut the contents of the zip folder in a Gitub repository.\nHow does Github work? (30min) >\nYou should now have a page with your code under\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name. This is a view of\nyour code, and you should see a list of your files, including an\nindex.html.\nNow all that remains is to publish your website! Still under\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name, find the settings\nicon in the top right corner.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFind the section named \"Github Pages\" and select \"master branch\" in source,\nthen hit \"Save\".\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWait a few minutes, then refresh the page and come back to the Github Pages\nsection. You should see a green bar saying \"Your site is published at\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name\". Click the link,\nverify that your website is there, then share it with your CYF class!\n\nTerminal basics\nDuring your course journey and onwards, the terminal (also known as\ncommand line) will be one of your most valuable tools. It will help you to\ninteract with you computer faster, by helping you to:\n\nCreate and delete files.\nInstall web development tools.\nStart a server.\nUse source control (explained later in this lesson).\n\nAll this will make sense as we progress with the lessons. For now, we would like\nyou to get familiar with it by following this tutorial:\n\nLearn the command line >\n\nHow do I use it on my computer?\nSo now that you know what the terminal can do for you, how do you use it? Please\nfind instructions for your operating system below. After you have followed the\ninstructions, open a terminal and write ls, then press the Enter key. You\nwill see something like this:\n\n  \n\n\nCommonly used commands\nThere's a set of commands you should become comfortable with during the course to allow you to effectively move around the filesystem and write software on your laptop.\n\ncd - change directory. To move up into the parent directory use: cd ..\nls - list the contents of a directory. Can also be used as ls [directory_name] to list the contents of a specific directory without actually moving (with cd) to it\npwd - print the full location of your current directory\nmkdir [name] - create a new directory, with the given name after a space\ntouch [file_name] - create a new file, with the given name (don't forget to add the extension, like .css or .html)\nrm [file_name] - remove a file\nrm -r [directory_name] - remove a directory (and all files inside that directory)\n\nLinux\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications\navailable in your computer.\nMore instructions >\nmacOS (Apple)\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications\navailable in your computer.\nMore instructions >\nWindows\nInstall Git. It will bring with it a tool\ncalled \"Git Bash\". When the mentors ask you to open a terminal or command line,\nplease open \"Git Bash\".\nGit\nWe will use Git as our Version Control System (also known as Source Control).\nIt's like Dropbox for developers. But much better!\n\nWhat is \"version control\"? Version control is a system that records\nchanges to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific\nversions later.\nIt allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire\nproject back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last\nmodified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue\nand when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things\nup or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for\nvery little overhead.\nExtract from\nGit Pro book\n\nThis answer on StackOverflow by\nsi618 explains very well why we\nuse Version Control.\nSo what is Git? Git is one of many Version Control Systems available to use,\nand by far\nthe most popular.\nWhat is Github? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and\nshare your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.\nGet Started\nFollow this tutorial from Github to setup Git\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/\nThen\nlearn how to use git from the Terminal >\nTry completing this tutorial > as well to learn more\nintermediate features, like branching.\nA typical workflow\n\nIf you're basing your work from another project, the first step is typically\nto fork their repo. Read this guide for instructions\n(https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)\n\nIf you're starting a new project then you should follow these steps\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/\n\n\nUsing Git through the Terminal\n\ngit init if it is a new project, i.e. a project not cloned from a\nrepo (or a fork of a repo)\ngit add . to add local files to the index\ngit commit -m \"Good explanation of your file changes\" to commit files to the\nlocal repo\ngit remote add origin GitRepoRemoteUrl if it is a new project (to\nsetup the remote url)\ngit remote -v to verify that the remote url is set correctly\ngit push -u origin master to push your commits to the remote url (Github in\nour case)\n\nYou will also typically need to set up your email and name once when you install\nGit git config --global user.name  and `git config --global user.email\n`.\nUsing Git through a graphical interface\nIf you don't feel comfortable with the terminal just yet, download the\nGithub client. If possible, however, we\nrecommend becoming comfortable with the Terminal commands and understanding the\nsteps for the different workflows before moving on to visual Git clients.\nGithub client guides >\nPull Requests\nYou should also learn how to create and work with\nPull Requests.\nGithub\nDuring our course, we will be using Github to store our\ncode. Github is the most popular Git service around, and is used by many large\ncompanies, like Facebook, Airbnb and The Guardian.\nMigraCode's Github page >\nMore Resources\n\nFollow this tutorial to learn the basic Git commands\nhttps://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git\nAnother good resource: Git - the simple guide\nhttp://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\nA more detailed tutorial that goes into advanced topics of Git -\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control\nYou can also check this visual explanation of different commands and what they\ndo: http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace\nThere are GUI software - Gitkraken is one of them https://www.gitkraken.com/\nThis Glossary has definitions of the terms normally used with Git:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/\n\nIDE\nIDE stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\". It is the software that you\nwill be using to write most of your code. It is designed to help you develop\nyour apps quickly, focusing on the problems that you need to solve instead of\nhaving to search Google for minor details.\nAuto-complete\nOne of the most important features of an IDE is that it provides\n\"auto-completion\". This means that it will give you suggestions of what you can\ncan write next, while you are typing something.\nFor example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can\nassign it to.\n\n  \n\n\nFile tree view\nThe reason why we call it \"Integrated\" is that you almost don't need to leave\nthe window to write your app. For example, creating, renaming and moving files\ncan be done directly from the IDE. This functionality can be achieved from\nsomething called a \"Tree view\", which you can usually find on the left side of\nyour IDE.\n\n  \n\n\nFinding files\nWhen working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly,\nwithout having to go through the tree view manually.\n\n  \n\n\nMost IDEs will allow you to do this with a sequence of keys.\nVSCode sequence: Windows/Linux Ctrl + P | Mac Cmd + P\nInstall an IDE\nFor this course, we recommend the usage of\nVS Code. Please go ahead and install it, then\ntry opening an HTML file with it via File > Open.\nInstall VS Code >\nOther IDEs\nBesides VS Code, the IDEs below are also popular with web developers. Feel free\nto check out their websites and see the differences between them and VS Code.\n\nAtom\nWebstorm\n\nHomework\n\nIf you have not yet moved your website from CodePen to Github, do it now.\nPlease use the information in this section to complete it.\nWhen your website is live at https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name,\nplease send a link to the slack channel of your class.\nLearn how to navigate your computer using a Terminal (view files, copy files).\nInstall VS Code.\nOpen your website with VS Code and add something to it: text, images, update\nCSS. Commit your changes to Github and verify that\nhttps://your-username.github.io/your-site-name has been updated!\n\nIt's alright if you are getting stuck or if something doesn't look right! When\nit happens, please ask your mentors or classmates for help in Slack.\n"},"others/house-rules.html":{"url":"others/house-rules.html","title":"House Rules","keywords":"","body":"House Rules\n\nWhilst you're a student, arrive on time.

We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form, and sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community activity.\nHarassment\nHarassment is a form of discrimination under the Equality Act 2010. Discrimination which is against the Equality Act is unlawful. This means action can be taken against you the civil courts.\nHarassment may be verbal, non-verbal or physical. Examples of unwanted conduct are:\n\nVerbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion\nOffensive and suggestive remarks (including emails, messages and other electronic communications, posters, objects, written materials or graffiti)\nIntimate questions\nFoul or obscene language\nInnuendo and derogatory comments\nJokes, banter, teasing, nicknames, ridicule or insults\nInappropriate comments about dress, appearance, physique or abilities\nPersistent requests for social activities (after it has been made clear that such requests are unwelcome) or other persistent unwelcome attention of a personal nature\nWhistling, winking and suggestive or offensive gestures\nDeliberate ignoring or isolation of a community member\nInappropriate physical contact (including touching, standing too close, pinching, pushing and grabbing)\nSustained disruption of talks, working groups or other events\nUnwelcome sexual attention or suggestive behaviour (which the harasser may perceive as harmless)\nThreats, assault or coercing sexual acts\nRacist, sexist, homophobic or ageist jokes, or derogatory or stereotypical remarks about a particular ethnic or religious group or gender\nMocking, mimicking or belittling a person's disability\nSexual images in public spaces\nDeliberate intimidation, stalking, or following\nHarassing photography or recording\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour\n\nA person may also be harassed even if they were not the intended \"target\". For example, a person may be harassed by racist jokes about a different ethnic group if the jokes create an offensive environment.\nOur position is that no harassment of any kind should take place and all community members have a responsibility to ensure at all times that their own behaviour does not offend others.\nThe Equality Act defines harassment as where behaviour is meant to or has the effect of either violating dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. This means it’s harassment even if the harasser didn’t mean to offend or intimidate, as long as the harassment has one of the above effects.\nBullying\nBullying is any behaviour or action (whether physical, verbal or non-verbal) that is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting intended to undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient. It also includes an abuse or misuse of power, deliberately setting an individual up to fail and unjustified intimidation.\nIn addition to the examples listed for harassment above, bullying  may also include but is not limited to:\n\nShouting in public\nPersistent or unfair criticism\nOstracising people\nPhysical or psychological threats and instilling fear\nSpreading malicious rumours\nConstantly undervaluing effort/achievement\nWithholding information\n\nResponsibilities\nCommunity members have a responsibility to behave in a way that is not offensive to others and to acknowledge that views and opinions held by others may not always coincide with their own.\nReporting\nIf you are being harassed or bullied or notice that this is happening to someone else, or have any other concerns, please contact Vincent van Grondele at vincent@openculturalcenter.org.

If you want to refresh your memory, read this quick guide to the HTML syntax.\nAll together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example:\n\n    Learning HTML\n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\n\nExercise: Which parts are the Tags and which parts are the Attributes.\n\nHTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called \"nesting\" tags or creating an HTML \"tree\". Between the opening  tag and the closing  tag there are three other tags. We call these \"child\" tags, because they have a parent-child relationship.\n\n\nExercise: As a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in the following example.\n\n\n    Learning HTML\n    \n        Author:\n        Code Your Future\n    \n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\nBegin Individual Exercises\nDuring this module, you will use an exercise project to practice what you learn. To begin, open the repository, scroll down and follow the instructions in the image below.\n\nFor now, stop after you complete exercises 1 and 2.\nSemantic HTML\nWhen writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Wikipedia\n\nWe'll cover the following semantic tags and talk about their use on the BBC News website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than 100 semantic tags. If you would like, you can review several semantic tags.\n\nGroup Discussion: How does semantic HTML relate to the Separation of Concerns that we discussed at the start of the class?\n\nAdd CSS and JavaScript\nDuring your application process, you wrote CSS code. Later in this course you will learn about JavaScript. Both are different languages from HTML.\nA typical webpage will require three files, one for each language:\n\nindex.html\nstyles.css\nmain.js\n\nTo use all of the files together, we have to tell the HTML code to load the other two files. Use the  tag to add the CSS file and the  tag to add the JavaScript:\n\n  \n    Example Webpage\n    \n  \n  \n    My webpage content.\n    \n  \n\n\nThe  tag must be placed in the  element. Usually, the  tag appears near the end of the  element of the HTML page:\n\nGroup Discussion: How do these files relate to the Separation of Concerns that we discussed at the start of the class?\n\nFile Paths\nThe HTML file isn't always in the same directory as the CSS and JavaScript files. It is common for them to appear in an assets directory.\n\nIn the example above, the  would have to be:\n\n\n\nWant to learn more?

Let's review the most common selectors.\n\n\n\n\nYou can review the most Common Selectors.\n\nCSS Properties\nCSS properties allow you to change the way an element appears on your HTML page. You do this by assigning values to properties. Consider the properties and values in CSS code below.\np {\n  color: darkslategrey;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  line-height: 1.8em;\n}\n\n\nGroup Exercise: Think of a chair. It might be green or red, tall or short. As a group, brainstorm as many properties and values as you can imagine for a chair.\n\nBox Model\nIn CSS, every element is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around this box can be modified with properties that we call margins, borders and padding. Here's a diagram showing what the box looks like.\n\nComplete exercises 5, 6 and 7 from the exercise project.\nAdvanced CSS Selectors\nYou can use more advanced CSS selectors to limit your selections. Read about Child Selectors, Sibling Selectors, Pseudo Classes, and other complex selectors.\nThen complete exercise 8 from the exercise project.\nGit Branching\nYou have been using git to track the changes you make to your exercises project. Each time you commit, you save a copy of your files.\n\nWhen you create a new branch, you create a separate line of commits.\n\nWith branches, you can work on two copies of your project and switch back and forth.\n\nComplete exercise 9 from the exercise project to learn how to use git branches.\n\nIf you want to go deeper, read this article on how git branching works.\n\nResources\nUse the following resources to learn more about the topics we covered this week.\n\nHTML5 - semantic elements\nCSS Selectors - MDN\nThe Cascade - MDN\nBox Model - MDN\nBox Model, box-sizing: border-box - CSS Tricks\nCSS specificity - MDN\n\nHomework\n\nComplete all of the exercises from week 1.\n\n(Est. 2 hours) Read about advanced CSS selectors and then practice by playing this CSS selector game.

To ensure we're presenting a website that's easy to use on any device, we use Responsive Web Design techniques to modify how content is displayed depending on the viewport.\n\nExercise: As a group, let's brainstorm as many devices as we can think of which might access the websites we build.\n\nSee how much variety there is in viewport sizes.\nMedia Queries\nAs you learned in your homework assignment, media queries help us change the display of our content depending on the size of the viewport. Let's review what you learned and break down a media query:\n@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n  body {\n    background: red;\n  }\n}\n\nIn this media query, we're assigning a red background color to the  element whenever the viewport is larger than 900px, and we're viewing on a screen.\n\n@media starts the media query\nscreen tells it to apply these styles to screen displays. Other displays\nmight be print, for when a webpage is being printed.\n(min-width: 900px) tells it to apply these styles when the viewport is\nlarger than 900px\n\nFinally, we wrap all of our styles for this media query in the brackets { and }, just like a CSS rule.\nComplete exercise 10 from the exercise project.\nFlexbox\nFlexbox allows you to arrange things on a webpage. These can be buttons,  elements, paragraphs, anything you want!\nTo add flexbox:\n\nIdentify the elements you want to arrange in a certain way. Let's use this for now:\n\n  Home\n  Gallery\n  Contact\n\n\nMake sure they're part of the same container:\n\n  \n    Home\n    Gallery\n    Contact\n  \n\n\nTell the container to use Flexbox to arrange all its children\n\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n}\n\nOnce you have flexbox applied to the container you can start adding more rules to tell it exactly how the elements should be arranged.\nflex-direction\nDisplay elements in a row\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n}\n\n\nDisplay elements in a column\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n\njustify-content\nSpace out elements equally in a row\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  justify-content: space-between; /* OR space-around */\n}\n\n\nSpace out elements equally in a column\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: space-between; /* OR space-around */\n}\n\n\n\nImportant: In the above 2 examples we used the same rule (justify-content: space-between;), but we changed the flex-direction from row to column. Notice how justify-content works in the same direction as flex-direction. In the images above, the \"green\" arrow for justify-content is operating in the same direction as flex-direction.\n\nalign-items\nAlign elements in a row\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n\nAlign elements on a column\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n\n\nImportant: While justify-content works in the same direction as flex-direction, align-items works the opposite way! Have a close look at the above images - the \"green\" arrow is opposite to the yellow flex-direction one.\n\nLearn more about flexbox by reading this helpful, visual and complete reference to the many properties you can use with flexbox.\nComplete exercises 11-17 from the exercise project.\nGit Merging\nLast week you used Git to create a branch so that you could work on two different copies of your project at the same time.\n\nThis week you will learn how to merge your changes in one branch back to your master branch.\n\nComplete exercise 18 from the exercise project.\nResources\nUse the following resources to learn more about the topics we covered this week.\n\nA Complete Guide to Flexbox\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete the \"Common Responsive Patterns\" lesson of the Responsive Web Design Fundamentals course.\n\n(Est. 4 hours) Follow along to as many videos as you can from What the Flexbox?!.

Complete the instructions under \"For Week 2\".\n\n\nExtra Credit\nThis week you learned how to layout content in CSS with Flexbox. In your work, you may be asked to use other layout techniques, such as CSS Grid, floats, or absolute positioning. Read about CSS Grids, and floats and absolute positioning.\nPrepare for the next class\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Next week we will learn how to collect user input.

You use them every day when you log into Slack, send an email, post to Facebook or sign up for services. Any time you enter information into a website, you are using a form.\n\nGroup Exercise: Look at the forms below. Can we identify the fields, labels and buttons that are used in these forms?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HTML Form\nA form always starts with a  tag and ends with . The action attribute is used to tell the form where to send the data.\nThe example below submits the form to Google's search engine.\n\n  ...\n\n\nThe method attribute can be set to GET or POST.

In that case, labels and fields can be linked together with the for and id attributes.\nUsername\n\n\nEvery field must have a . A field that does not have a  can not be used by someone with a visual impairment, even if it has other text to describe it.\nButtons\nButtons are used for many things. The most common purpose is to submit a form. When used to submit a form, they must have a type attribute with a value of submit.\nSearch Now\n\nSearch Now\n\nWhen a user clicks on a submit button, the information in the form is sent to the form's action attribute.\n\n  Search Now\n\n\n\nSearch Now\n\n\nComplete exercises 19, 20 and 21 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises.\nMore Field Types\nDifferent kinds of text\nThere are many  types that can be used to collect different information, such as phone numbers, email addresses, numbers and more. Here are some examples.\n\nPhone Number: \nEmail Address: \nNumbers: \nURL: \nAnd several more.\n\nEach  type identifies what kind of information should be entered. For example, phones will show different keyboards depending on if you are entering a phone number, a URL, or an email address.\n\nWant to learn more? Read about all of the input types.\n\nCheckboxes\nA checkbox allows the user to say yes or no to an option. With a checkbox, the user does not type the value into the field. You have to provide the value in a value attribute.\n\n  \n  Would you like to receive discounts by email?\n\n\n\n  \n  Would you like to receive discounts by email?\n\n\n\nCheckboxes that are related to each other can be grouped together in a . A group of fields is described by a .\n\n  What languages do you speak?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\n\n  What languages do you speak?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\n\n\nGroup Discussion: Checkboxes are an exception to the rule that every field must have a unique name attribute. In the example above, all three checkboxes have the same name attribute. What do you think will happen when more than one checkbox is selected?\n\nRadio Buttons\nRadio buttons are just like checkboxes, except the user can only select one option.\n\n  What is your preferred language?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\n\n  What is your preferred language?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\n\nComplete exercises 22, 23 and 24 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises.\nAccessibility\nAll fields must have a  and all fieldsets must have a . Sometimes you will have a form field that doesn't need a label. For example, a search field is often identified with an icon and a placeholder attribute.\n&#x1F50D; \n\n&#x1F50D; \nThis is clear for most users, but not for the visually impaired, who use a screen reader to browse the web. These users can not see the icon next to the field and their assistive technology may not read out the placeholder text.\nYou must add a  in order to be accessible to all users.\nSearch\n&#x1F50D; \n\nSearch\n&#x1F50D; \nFor sighted users, it now looks like there are two labels. In these circumstances, we use special CSS code to visually hide the label.\nHTML:\nSearch\n&#x1F50D; \n\nCSS:\n.screenreader {\n  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n  position: absolute !important;\n  left: -2000px;\n}\n\nSearch\n&#x1F50D; \n\nGroup Discussion: What are our obligations as software developers to make sure everyone can access the websites we build? How might people suffer if they can't access the web?\n\nFieldsets\nFieldsets can be used for any fields that are grouped together. This is often used to distinguish two groups of similar fields.\n\n  Mother\n  Given Name\n  \n  Family Name\n  \n\n\n  Father\n  Given Name\n  \n  Family Name\n  \n\n\n\n  Mother\n  Given Name\n  \n  Family Name\n  \n\n\n  Father\n  Given Name\n  \n  Family Name\n  \n\n\n\nComplete exercises 25 and 26 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises.\nForm Attributes\nThere are many attributes you can use on ,  and  fields.\nRequired\nA field with the required attribute will not allow the form to be submitted until the user has entered information.\n\n\nValue\nThe value attribute can be added to an  field to pre-fill information. This is often used when a website remembers your username during login.\n\n\n\n\nReadonly\nThe readonly attribute can be added to ,  and  fields to prevent the user from making changes to the field.\n\n\n\n\nChecked\nThe checked attribute can be added to a checkbox or radio button to pre-check the field. This is often used to select a default that the user may not want to change.\n\n  What languages do you speak?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\n\n  What languages do you speak?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\nComplete exercise 27 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises.\nGit Merge Conflicts\nLast week you used Git to merge your changes from one branch back into your master branch.\n\nSometimes Git can not automatically merge one branch into another, because each branch has modified the same line of code. Git does not know which version of the line is the correct one. When this happens, we have a \"merge conflict\".\n\nAs a developer, you have to tell Git which version of the line of code is correct.\nComplete exercise 28 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises to learn how to resolve a merge conflict.\nRetrospective\nAt the end of each module, we'll have a retrospective. What went right? What went wrong? What do we need to do as a group to learn better? Let's discuss the HTML/CSS module.\nResources\n\nHTML Forms at Marksheet.io\nBuilding Forms at ShayHowe.com\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete Lesson 1 of this course on Building High Conversion Web Forms.\n(Est. 1-2  hours) Complete videos 1-16 in Lesson 2 of the same course as above. You can stop after lesson 17.\nRevise what you've learned during the HTML/CSS module. Next week we'll have a short quiz for you.\n\nPrepare for the next class\nNext week, we will begin learning and programming JavaScript.

This is the repo we will use during the class, and for homework.\n\nInstall Node\nWindows and Mac users\nDownload the installer (.msi or .pkg) from https://nodejs.org/en/download\n\nLinux (Ubuntu) users\nRun the following commands in your terminal:\n  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -\n  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nSource: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions\n\nA note on security: This will require you to enter a password. Don't execute a script on your terminal if you don't trust its source, especially if they use the sudo command to get admin access to your machine.\n\n2. Test installation\nGo to your terminal and run the command: node -v.\nYou should get the node version printed on your terminal. For example, v8.9.3.\nSetup IDE\nThere are some tools that will help you to write code. One of these, Prettier, formats your code, making it easier for you and others to read.\n1. Install prettier\n\nIn Visual Studio open the extensions panel (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_browse-and-install-extensions)\nSearch for Prettier - Code formatter\nClick install on the top result\n\n2. Enable formatting on save\n\nIn Visual Studio open the settings file (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_creating-user-and-workspace-settings)\nSearch for editor format\nSet editor.formatOnSave and editor.formatOnPaste to true\n\nHello World\nIt is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any language is make it output 'Hello world!'.\nWe'll do this in JavaScript, using a command called console.log().\nInside of exercise.js there's a line of code that will print \"Hello world!\".\n1. Run the program\n\nOpen a terminal window\nChange directory to this folder (cd week-1/C-hello-world)\nRun the program using node (node exercise.js)\n\n2. Experiment\n\nTry to console.log() something different. For example, 'Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!'.\nTry to console.log() several things at once.\nWhat happens when you get rid of the quote marks?\nWhat happens when you console.log() just a number without quotes?\n\nVariables\nWhen you write code, you'll want to create shortcuts to data values so you can don't have to write out the same value every time.\nWe can use variable to create a reference to a value.\nvar greeting = \"Hello world\";\n\nconsole.log(greeting);\n\nThe program above will print \"Hello world\" to the console. Notice how it uses the value assigned to the variable greeting.\nExercise\n\nAdd a variable greeting to exercise.js (make sure it comes before the console.log)\nPrint your greeting to the console 3 times\n\n\nRemember: to run this exercise you must change directory to the D-variables. If you already have a terminal window open for the previous exercise you can do this by running the command cd ../D-variables.\n\nExpected result\nHello world\nHello world\nHello world\n\nStrings\nIn programming there are different types of data. You've used one data type already: string.\nComputers recognise strings as a sequence of characters but to humans, strings are simply lines of text.\nvar message = \"This is a string\";\n\nNotice that strings are always wrapped inside of quote marks. We do this so that the computer knows when the string starts and ends.\nYou can check that the data is a string by using the typeof operator:\nvar message = \"This is a string\";\nvar messageType = typeof message;\n\nconsole.log(messageType); // logs 'string'\n\nExercise\n\nWrite a program that logs a message and its type\n\nExpected result\nThis is a string\nstring\n\nString concatenation\nYou can add two strings together using the plus operator (+):\nvar greetingStart = \"Hello, my name is \";\nvar name = \"Daniel\";\n\nvar greeting = greetingStart + name;\n\nconsole.log(greeting); // Logs \"Hello, my name is Daniel\"\n\nExercise\n\nWrite a program that logs a message with a greeting and your name\n\nExpected result\nHello, my name is Daniel\n\nNumbers\nThe next data type we will learn is number.\nUnlike strings, numbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes.\nvar age = 30;\n\nYou can use mathematical operators to caclulate numbers:\nvar sum = 10 + 2; // 12\nvar product = 10 * 2; // 20\nvar quotient = 10 / 2; // 5\nvar difference = 10 - 2; // 8\n\nExercise\n\nCreate two variables numberOfStudents and numberOfMentors\nLog a message that displays the total number of students and mentors\n\nExpected result\nNumber of students: 15\nNumber of mentors: 8\nTotal numnber of students and mentors: 23\n\nFloats\nNumbers can be integers (whole numbers) or floats (numbers with a decimal).\nvar preciseAge = 30.612437;\n\nFloats can be rounded to the nearest whole number using the Math.round function:\nvar preciseAge = 30.612437;\nvar roughAge = Math.round(preciseAge); // 30\n\nExercise\n\nUsing the variables provided in the exercise calculate the percentage of mentors and students in the group\n\nExpected result\nPercentage students: 65%\nPercentage mentors: 35%\n\nFunctions\nFunctions are blocks of code that can do a task as many times as you ask it to. They take an input and return an output.\nHere's a function that doubles a number:\nfunction double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n}\n\nTo use the function we need to:\na) call it with an input and\nb) assign the returned value to a variable\nvar result = double(2);\n\nconsole.log(result); // 4\n\nExercise 1\n\nComplete the function in exercise.js so that it halves the input\nTry calling the function more than once with some different numbers\n\n\nRemember to use the return keyword to get a value out of the function\n\nExpected result\n6\n\nExercise 2\n\nComplete the function in exercise2.js so that it triples the input\n\nExpected result\n24\n\nFunction Parameters\nThe input given to a function is called a parameter.\nA function can take more than one parameter:\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nWhen you write a function (sometimes called declaring a function) you assign names to the parameters inside of the parentheses (()). Parameters can be called anything.\nThis function is exactly the same as the on above:\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n  return num1 + num2;\n}\n\nExercise 1\n\nWrite a function that multiplies two numbers together\n\nExpected result\n12\n\nExercise 2\n\nFrom scratch, write a function that divides two numbers\n\nExpected result\n0.75\n\nExercise 3\n\nWrite a function that takes a name (a string) and returns a greeting\n\nExpected result\nHello, my name is Daniel\n\nExercise 4\n\nWrite a function that adds two numbers together\nCall the function, passing 13 and 124 as parameters, and assigning the returned value to a variable sum\n\nExpected result\n137\n\nExercise 5\n\nWrite a function that takes a name (a string) and an age (a number) and returns a greeting (a string)\n\nExpected result\nHello, my name is Daniel and I'm 30 years old\n\nNested Functions\nFunctions are very powerful.\n\nYou can write more than one line of code inside of functions.\nYou can use variables inside of functions.\nYou can call other functions inside of functions!\n\nfunction getAgeInDays(age) {\n  return age * 365;\n}\n\nfunction createCreeting(name, age) {\n  var ageInDays = getAgeInDays(age);\n  var message =\n    \"My Name is \" + name + \" and I was born over \" + ageInDays + \" days ago!\";\n  return message;\n}\n\nExercise 1\n\nIn exercise.js write a program that displays the percentage of students and mentors in the group\nThe percentage should be rounded to the nearest whole number (use a search engine to find out how to this with JavaScript)\nYou should have one function that calculates the percentage, and one function that creates a message\n\n\nConsider: should your percentage function do the rounding, or should it be done when the greeting is created?\n\nExpected result\nPercentage students: 65%\nPercentage mentors: 35%\n\nExercise 2\n\nIn exercise2.js you have been provided with the names of some mentors. Write a program that logs a shouty greeting to each one.\nYour program should include a function that spells their name in uppercase, and a function that creates a shouty greeting.\nLog each greeting to the console.\n\nExpected result\nHELLO DANIEL\nHELLO IRINA\nHELLO MIMI\nHELLO ROB\nHELLO YOHANNES\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you\nhave forked during this class contains few challenges - solve all the pending exercises in week-1 and week-1-practise in\nJavaScript!\n\n"},"js-core/week-05/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core/week-05/lesson.html","title":"Week 5 - Arrays","keywords":"","body":"\nJavaScript Core I - 2\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nExpressions\nBoolean Filters\nComparison operators\nPredicates\nConditionals\nLogical Operators\nMore Conditionals\nArray literals\nArray properties\nArray getters and setters\nArray methods\nMore Array methods\nArray map\n\n\n\nPlease make sure you're working on the js-exercises repo Week 2 folder during this class.\n\nExpressions\nIn JavaScript there are expressions and statements. We will use these words frequently to describe code.\nExpression\nAn expression returns a value. Sometimes we will say that an expression evaluates to a value.\nThe following are all examples of expressions:\n1 + 1; // returns 2\n(\"hello\"); // returns \"hello\"\n2 * 4; // returns 8\n\"hello\" + \"world\"; // returns \"helloworld\"\n\nWe can take the value produced by an expression and assign it to a variable. That line of code would be called a statement.\nStatement\nA statement is some code that performs an action. Here are some examples:\nvar sum = 1 + 1; // action: assigns result of `1 + 1` to variable `sum`\nvar greeting = \"hello\"; // action: assigns result of the expression \"hello\" to variable `greeting`\nconsole.log(2 * 4); // action: logs the result of `2 * 4` to the console\nsayGreeting(greeting); // action: calls the function `sayGreeting` with the parameter `greeting`\n\nThere are some other different types of statements that we will learn in the coming weeks.\nExercise\nYou quickly find out the result of an expression by running node in a terminal window.\n\nOpen a terminal window\nRun the command node\nYou have now opened a node console (also called a REPL)\nType an expression and press enter\nTo exit the console type Ctrl+C or type the command .exit\n\nExample from inside a terminal window:\n$ node\n> 1 + 2\n3\n> \"hello\"\n'hello'\n> var greeting = \"hello\"\nundefined\n> greeting\n'hello'\n> console.log(greeting)\nhello\nundefined\n> .exit\n$\n\n\nNotice how when we execute an expression the value it produces is printed below it. When we execute a statement, we see undefined printed below. This is because statements don't produce values like expressions, they do something.\n\n\nWrite some more expressions in the node console\nAssign some expressions to variables\nCheck the value of the variables\n\nFurther reading on using the node console: https://hackernoon.com/know-node-repl-better-dbd15bca0af6\nBoolean Filters\nThere is a special data type in JavaScript known as a boolean value. A boolean is either true or false, and it should be written without quotes.\nvar codeYourFutureIsGreat = true;\n\nExercise\nHead over to exercise.js and follow the instructions in the comments.\nComparison Operators\nWe can also write expressions that return boolean values.\nHere's an expression that evaluates to a boolean.\n1 > 2\n\n\nCan you work out what value this expression evaluates to?\n\nThe > symbol in the expression is a comparison operator. Comparison operators compare two values. This operator checks to see if the number on the left is bigger than the number on the right.\n1 is not bigger than 2 so this expression returns false.\nMore comparison operators\n>   greater than\n=  greater than or equal\n=== same value\n!== not the same value\n\nExercise\n\nOpen exercise.js and follow the instructions.\nOpen a node console, and write some expressions that use comparison operators\n\nPredicates\nPredicate is a fancy word for a function that returns a boolean value.\nThese functions are very useful because they let you test if a value satisifies certain requirements.\nfunction isNumber(value) {\n  return typeof value === \"number\";\n}\n\nisNumber(10); // returns true\nisNumber(\"hello\"); // returns false\n\nJavaScript programmers often give predicate functions a name that starts with a verb e.g. isBig, isNegative, isActive, shouldUpdate,\nCalling a predicate function is like asking a question: \"is this value a number\". The return value is the answer to your question.\nConditionals\nLike humans, computer programs make decisions based on information given to them. Conditionals are a way of representing these decisions in code.\nFor example:\n\nIn a game, if the player has 0 lives, then the game is over\nIn a weather app, if rain is forecast, a picture of rain clouds is shown\n\nThe most common type of conditional is the if statement.\nAn if statment runs some code if a condition is met. If the condition is not met, then the code will be skipped.\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nif (isHappy) {\n  console.log(\"I am happy\");\n}\n\nThe code in paratheses - e.g. (isHappy) - is the condition. The condition can be any expression. The following are all valid conditions:\n// boolean value\nif (true) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// variable assigned to boolean value\nif (isHappy) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// equality operator returns a boolean value\nif (1 + 1 === 2) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// comparison operator returns a boolean value\nif (10 > 5) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// function call returns boolean value\nif (greaterThan10(5)) {\n  // do something\n}\n\nAn if statement runs code when a condition is met. What if the condition is not met? Sometimes you want to run an alternative bit of code.\nAn if...else statement also runs code when the condition is not met.\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nif (isHappy) {\n  console.log(\"I am happy &#x1F604;\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"I am not happy &#x1F622;\");\n}\n\nLogical Operators\nThere are three logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT).\nThey let you write expressions that evaluate to a boolean value.\nSuppose you want to test if a number if bigger than 3 and smaller than 10. We can write this using logical operators.\nvar num = 10;\n\nfunction satisfiesRequirements(num) {\n  if (num > 3 && num \nWe can test expressions with logical operators in a node console too:\n$ node\n> var num = 10;\nundefined\n> num > 5 && num  num  false || true\ntrue\n> !true\nfalse\n> var greaterThan5 = num > 5\nundefined\n> !greaterThan5\nfalse\n> !(num === 10)\nfalse\n\nMore Conditionals\nA common use of if statements is inside of functions.\nfunction getGrade(score) {\n  if (score >= 80) {\n    return \"A\";\n  }\n  if (score >= 60) {\n    return \"B\";\n  }\n}\n\nYou can also write this using else if:\nfunction getGrade(score) {\n  if (score >= 80) {\n    return \"A\";\n  } else if (score >= 60) {\n    return \"B\";\n  }\n}\n\nArray Literals\nIf you ever find yourself writing code like this...\nvar mentor1 = \"Daniel\";\nvar mentor2 = \"Irina\";\nvar mentor3 = \"Rares\";\n\n...then it's probably time to use an array!\nArrays are data structures that hold a list of values.\nvar mentors = [\"Daniel\", \"Irina\", \"Rares\"];\n\nArrays can hold any type of value (although almost always you only have one data type per array).\nvar testScores = [16, 49, 85];\nvar grades = [\"F\", \"D\", \"A\"];\nvar greetings = [\"Hello, how are you?\", \"Hi! Nice to meet you!\"];\n\nArray properties\nArrays, like strings, have a length property.\nYou can check this by starting a node console in your terminal.\n$ node\n> var arr = [1, 2, 3];\nundefined\n> arr\n[1, 2, 3]\n> arr.length\n3\n\nArray Getters and Setters\nYou can get a single value out of an array using bracket notation.\n$ node\n> var ingredients = [\"Flour\", \"Water\", \"Salt\"];\nundefined\n> ingredients[0]\nFlour\n> ingredients[1]\nWater\n> ingredients.length\n3\n\nDid you notice how we use [0] to get the first value? In programming we count starting at zero.\n\nThe number inside of the brackets is called an index. Index just means the position of the item within the array.\n\nYou can also set a value using bracket notation and an assignment operator (=).\nvar scores = [80, 41, 47];\n\nscores[2] = 29; // Change the last score\nscores[3] = 51; // Add a new score\n\nArray methods\nDo you remember how strings have special functions called methods? Don't worry if not! Here's an example to jog your memory:\n$ node\n> var name = \"Daniel\"\nundefined\n> name.toLowerCase()\ndaniel\n\nArrays also have several methods that you can use.\n.sort()\nAn array method that sorts the values in an array into ascending alphabetical order.\nvar unorderedLetters = [\"z\", \"v\", \"b\", \"f\", \"g\"];\nvar orderedLetters = unorderedLetters.sort();\n\nconsole.log(orderedLetters); // logs [ 'b', 'f', 'g', 'v', 'z' ]\n\n\nWhen you call an array method it uses the array on the left side of the dot as an input, and returns a new, transformed, array.\n\n.concat()\nAdds (or concatenates) another value or array to the array.\n$ node\n> var arr = [1, 2, 3]\nundefined\n> arr.concat(4)\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n> arr\n[1, 2, 3]\n\nDid you notice how calling the concat method did not change arr? This is because concat, like most array methods, returns a new array, it does not alter the one you called the method on.\nIf you wan to use the array returned by calling .concat() you should store it in a new variable.\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\nvar newArr = arr.concat(4);\n\nconsole.log(newArr); // logs [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nMore Array methods\nLet's explore some more array methods.\n.slice()\nReturns a slice of the array.\nYou can tell .slice() where you want the slice to begin and end by passing it two parameters.\n$ node\n> var arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nundefined\n> arr.slice(0, 2)\n[0, 1]\n> [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"].slice(1, 2)\n['b']\n\n.includes()\nReturns true if a value is in the array.\nvar mentors = [\"Daniel\", \"Irini\", \"Ashleigh\", \"Rob\", \"Etzali\"];\n\nfunction isAMentor(name) {\n  return mentors.includes(name);\n}\n\nconsooe.log(\"Is Rukmuni a mentor?\");\nconsole.log(isAMentor(\"Rukmini\")); // logs false\n\n.join()\nReturns all the array values joined together in a string.\n$ node\n> [\"H\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"].join()\n'Hello'\n\nThere is a string method .split(). In an interactive console try using the string .split() method and the array .join(). How could they work together?\nArray map\nImagine you have an array of names...\nvar mentors = [\"Daniel \", \"irina \", \" Gordon\", \"ashleigh \"];\n\nYou notice that he names are not formatted consistently. To fix the array you decide you need to trim whitespace and convert to lowercase.

Once it returns true, we can stop going through the array and grab the item that passed the predicate's test. Sounds complicated! Thankfully there is an array method that does just this!\n.find()\nSearches through the array and returns the value of the first item that satisfies a predicate function.\nvar longName = names.find(isLongName);\n\nconsole.log(longName); // logs Mozafar\n\nArray some\nImagine you have an array of numbers:\nvar numbers = [1, 3, -1, 5, 9];\n\nYou know that the array is supposed to contain positive numbers, but you want to check if it also contains any negative numbers.\nWe can write a function that checks this:\nfunction isNegative(number) {\n  return number \nTo check your array of numbers, you'd have to run this function against every number in the array.

How do you do that for every value in the array?\nWe can write a function that checks if one score is greater than 80:\nfunction isHighScore(score) {\n  return score > 80;\n}\n\nTo find out which scores were greater than 80, you'd have to run this function against every score in the array, and push the 80+ scores into a new array.

This week we'll study how it works in more depth.\nYou might remember this example:\nfunction double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n}\n\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nvar numbersDoubled = numbers.map(double);\n\nThe map() method runs the function we provided (double) on each item in the array and uses the return values to create a new array. In the example numbersDoubled is a new array containing [2, 4, 6].\nCallback functions\nA function that we provide to a method is commonly called a callback function. The term highlights that although we provide the double function, the .map() method calls it. (Notice how we never write double() to call the function).\nWe'll see callback functions used a lot more in the coming weeks. \nOften, when a function is only needed for a map operation, developers will declare the callback function inside of the method call. Let's try copying and pasting the function declaration inside of the .map() method call.\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nvar numbersDoubled = numbers.map(function double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n});\n\nWe can make this shorter by removing the function name. We can do this because we are not using the function anywhere else in the code, so we do not need the function name to reference it.\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nvar numbersDoubled = numbers.map(function (number) {\n  return number * 2;\n});\n\nWe can make this code even shorter still. In the latest versions of JavaScript a way of declaring functions was introduced called arrow functions. \nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nvar numbersDoubled = numbers.map(number => {\n  return number * 2\n});\n\nThe arrow function syntax lets you declare a function without the function keyword. (There are some other subtle differences between arrow functions and regular functions that you will learn about at a much later stage).\nThere is one last thing you can do to make your code shorter. If you remove the braces ({}) from an arrow function, the body of the function will be returned without needing to write the return keyword.\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nvar numbersDoubled = numbers.map(number => number * 2);\n\nIn the example above, the expression number * 2 is automatically returned because it comes directly after the => arrow (instead of coming after curly braces). This is called an implicit return.\nArray Foreach\nThe .forEach() method is similar to .map() except it does not return a new array. Therefore .forEach() is only useful if you want to perform side effects.\nSide effects\nGenerally, functions should take an input and return an output (based on that input), and not do anything else.\nWhen functions meet this criteria they can be called pure functions.\nA pure function does not:\n\naccess any data unless it was passed in as a parameter\nchange data declared outside the function\ninteracts with anything outside of the function (e.g. logs a message to the console, shows a message on a website, saves data to disk)\n\nThese are all example of side effects. Of course, from time to time, we will need to perform side effects, but we should try to avoid side effects inside of functions and only have them when absolutely necessary.\nExample\nSay we want to log to the console a list of names.\nvar names = [\"Daniel\", \"mozafar\", \"irina\"];\n\nWe can use .forEach() to go through the array, item by item, and call a function we provide.\nnames.forEach(function(name, index) {\n  console.log(index + \": \" + name);\n});\n\nThis logs each name to the console as hoped, but we notice that the names are not formatted correctly. You might be tempted to format the name inside of the forEach function.\nHowever, it is good practise to write small functions with a single responsibility. So instead, we can write a formatName function (which we can re-use in other places) and pass it to .map() before calling .forEach().\nfunction formatName(name) {\n  return name.split(\"\")[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);\n}\n\nnames.map(formatName).forEach(function(name, index) {\n  console.log(index + \": \" + name);\n});\n\nChaining\nNotice how we were able to write one method after another e.g. names.map(formatName).forEach(log)? This is called method chaining.\nYou can call .forEach() after .map() because .map() returns a new array.\nConsider this code:\nvar namesFormatted = names.map(format);\nnamesFormatted.forEach(log);\n\nIt can be written more simply (without assigning the array returned from .map() to a variable):\nnames.map(format).forEach(log);\n\nBe careful though! You can not call .map() after .forEach.\nnames.forEach(log).map(formatName); // ERROR\n\nThis code does not work because forEach() does not return a new array (it returns undefined). The code is therefore attempting to call .map() on undefined, and undefined does not have a .map() method.\nHomework\n\nMake sure you finish all the pending exercies in The repo.\n\nSignup to CodeWars and work on these challenges\n\n\nfunctions, types, conditionals etc...\n\neven or odd\ncode under pressure\nsecret message\nconvert boolean\nopposite number\nreturn negative\nhydrated\nbonus\nremove string spaces\nremove first and last character\nstring repeat\nmathematical operations\n\nArrays (optional)\n\ninvert values\nneedle in haystack\ncounting sheep\nsum of positive\npeople in bus\nsum without highest and lowest\nreveersed array of digits\nslash sum of negatives\n\n"},"js-core-2/":{"url":"js-core-2/","title":"JavaScript II","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core 2\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\n\n\n\n\nweek-07\nObjects\n\n\nweek-08\nJS in the Browser (DOM, and AJAX)\n\n\nweek-09\nMore JS in the Browser\n\n\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-07/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-07/lesson.html","title":"Week 7 - Objects","keywords":"","body":"\nJavaScript Core II - 1\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nObjects\nObjects Get and Set\nMore complex objects\nObject methods\nArrays of Objects\nObject.Keys()\n\n\n\nPlease make sure you're working on the js-exercises repo Week 4 during this class.\n\nObjects\nObjects in the real world have properties that describe how they are unique. Your laptop, for example, has a brand (Lenovo/Apple etc.), a screen size (13/15 inch), RAM (8/16GB) etc.\nHow would we describe the above laptop as a JavaScript object?\nvar laptop = {\n    brand: \"Lenovo\",\n    screenSize: 13,\n    isTouchscreen: true\n};\n\nUseful words to remember when talking about objects:\n\nobject literal: anything that has a set of {...} around a set of properties is an object literal\nproperty or key: brand, screenSize and isTouchScreen are properties/keys of the object\nvalues: \"Lenovo\", 13 and true are values of the object's properties\n\nObjects Get and Set\nGetting the value of an object's property\nLet's take one of the objects we looked at earlier..\nvar laptop = {\n    brand: \"Lenovo\",\n    screenSize: 13,\n    isTouchscreen: true\n};\n\n\nTry to console.log(laptop). The output might depend on your environment!\n\nTo find out the value of an object's property, you can use the dot notation..\nconsole.log(laptop.brand);\n\nYou can also use the bracket notation (although this is rarely used, it's good to know):\nconsole.log(laptop['brand']);\n\nSetting the value of a property\nSimilar to reading, if we want to set a property:\nlaptop.brand = \"Apple\";\n\nIt's strongly recommended you always use the same type when re-assigning an object's property (if it was a string before, keep it a string - and so on).\nvar laptop = {\n    brand: \"Lenovo\",\n    screenSize: 13,\n    isTouchscreen: true\n};\n\n// DON'T DO THIS\nlaptop.screenSize = \"15 inch\";\n\n// OK TO DO\nlaptop.screenSize = 15;\n\nMore Complex Objects\n Object properties can even be assigned other objects or variables too. The example below shows an object with keys that have been assigned a variable, an array, and an object.\nvar kittenName = \"Feathers\";\n\nvar kitten = {\n    name: kittenName,\n    toyCollection: ['blue ball', 'green ball', 'hoover box'],\n    favoriteLocation: {\n        roomName: 'Living room',\n        napPlace: 'window',\n        idealTemperatureCelsius: 24\n    }\n};\n\nObject Methods\nBesides having specific properties, objects in the real world can also do things. For example, a computer can display something on the screen, a person can say their names etc... In Javascript, we do this using 'methods'. A method is a function attached to a particular object. You have already used some predefined methods before, for example toUpperCase() on a string or filter() on an array.\nvar athlete = {\n    name: 'Usain Bolt',\n    goldMedals: 25,\n    sayHi: function() {\n        return \"Hi everybody!\";\n    }\n};\n\nHow do we call this method? \nathlete.sayHi(); // returns \"Hi everybody!\"\n\nAn object method can also rely on the other properties of the object to do more complex calculation. To reference the current object in the body of the method, we will use the keyword this. Let's take an example.\nvar athlete = {\n    name: 'Usain Bolt',\n    goldMedals: 25,\n    sayName: function() {\n        return \"My name is \" + this.name;\n    }\n};\n\nathlete.sayName(); // returns \"My name is Usain Bolt\"\n\nKnowing this, you can have methods which modify existing properties of your object.\nvar athlete = {\n    name: 'Usain Bolt',\n    goldMedals: 25,\n    winNewMedal: function() {\n        this.goldMedals = this.goldMedals + 1;\n    }\n};\n\nathlete.winNewMedal();\nconsole.log(athelete.goldMedals); // prints \"26\"\n\nAs methods are just functions attached to objects, they can also take parameters.\nvar athlete = {\n    name: 'Usain Bolt',\n    goldMedals: 25,\n    silverMedals: 7,\n    winNewMedal: function(medal) {\n        if (medal === \"gold\") {\n            this.goldMedals = this.goldMedals + 1;\n        } else {\n            this.silverMedals = this.silverMedals + 1;\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nathlete.winNewMedal(\"silver\");\nconsole.log(athlete.goldMedals); // prints \"25\"\nconsole.log(athlete.silverMedals); // prints \"8\"\n\nArrays of objects\nIn the past weeks, you've learned about using arrays of numbers, arrays of string etc... In the following, we will learn how to use arrays of objects.\nvar kitten1 = {\n    name: 'Fluffy',\n    weeksOld: 2\n};\n\nvar kitten2 = {\n    name: 'Megatron',\n    weeksOld: 1\n};\n\nvar kitten3 = {\n    name: 'Billy',\n    weeksOld: 5\n};\n\nvar kittens = [kitten1, kitten2, kitten3];\n\nYou can also use all the functions for arrays that you learned before: find, some, every, filter, map, forEach... As an example, we want to filter all the kittens who are less than 3 weeks old:\nfunction isYoungerThan3Weeks(kitten) {\n    return kitten.weeksOld \nWhat if we want to get an array of all the kitties names?\nfunction getName(kitten) {\n    return kitten.name;\n}\n\nkittens.map(getName);   // returns [\"Fluffy\", \"Megatron\", \"Billy\"]\n\nObject.Keys()\nSince we started JavaScript, we have used console.log to print things to our console.\nIn week 2 and 3, you learned about array methods like .map(), .length().\nThese are what we call built-in methods, and they're part of the JavaScript language. Someone else created these methods, and we can use them in our code.\nLike arrays, objects have build in methods that can help us. In this lesson, we will learn about Object.keys(). This method goes into our object, and returns the object property names as an array.\nHere is an example output for using .keys():\nvar footballClubs = {\n  chelsea_fc: 'England',\n  fc_barcelona: 'Spain',\n  ac_milan: 'Italy'\n};\n\nconsole.log(Object.keys(footballClubs));\n// prints [ 'chelsea_fc', 'fc_barcelona', 'ac_milan' ]\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo contains few challenges - solve all the pending exercises in week-4 and week-4-practise.\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html","title":"Week 8 - JS in the Browser","keywords":"","body":"\nJavaScript Core II - 2\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nJS In the Browser (The DOM)\nAJAX\n\n\n\nPlease make sure you're working on the js-exercises repo Week 5 during this class.\n\nJS in the Browser\nUp until now we've been using console.log to see the results of our code running, because it allows us to focus on writing code and seeing the results instantly. But JavaScript was not meant to be run in console.log: it was meant to make web pages pages dynamic.\nLots of websites are powered by JavaScript today, and some (like Facebook) cannot function at all without it: it's become that important to the look and feel of the website.\nThe DOM\nYour webpages are made up of a bunch of HTML elements, nested within each other (parents and children). But JavaScript doesn't know about any of that.\nThankfully, in JavaScript we have access to this \"DOM\" object (Document Object Model) which is actually a representation of our webpage that JavaScript can work with.\nHere are two examples, HTML and then JavaScript, of how the DOM might look like:\n\n    \n         Welcome! \n         Hello world! \n    \n\n\nvar document = {\n    body: {\n        h1: \"Welcome\",\n        p: \"Hello world!\"\n    }\n};\n\nThe DOM offers a lot of useful functions we can use to find elements on the page. Here are some we'll be using today:\n    document.querySelector('#mainHeader');\n    document.querySelectorAll('p');\n\nBoth .querySelector and querySelectorAll accept a CSS selector as an input.\n.querySelector selects only the first element it finds, querySelectorAll selects all elements (it returns an array).\nOnce you retrieve an element using .querySelector, you can attach an event to it. An event is any action that can be performed on that element. For now, we will just use the click event:\n    var myButton = document.querySelector('#myButton');\n    myButton.addEventListener(\"click\", alertSomething);\n\n    function alertSomething() {\n        alert(\"Something\");\n    }\n\nYou will notice in the example example that we passed a second argument to addEventListener. That second argument is the function that we want to invoke when that event has happened.\nThe elements returned by document.querySelector have the same properties as a normal HTML element: for example, you can get access to their css styles.\n    var myElement = document.querySelector('#myElement');\n    myElement.style.backgroundColor = 'red';\n\nUsing the document, you can also create new elements. These elements will not appear until you append them as a child of another element though:\n    var paragraph = document.createElement('p'); // here we're just creating it, element is not visible yet\n    myElement.appendChild(paragraph); // now the element is added to our view, but it's empty\n\ndocument.createElement accepts as an input any element type. So for example document.createElement('article') will create a new article element.\nYou can then change the text displayed inside elements using the innerText property:\n    paragraph.innerText = \"How are you?\"; // now we can see the text displaying on the screen\n\nWe've been using document.querySelector to retrieve a single element.\nTo retrieve an array of multiple elements (that match a specific class name for example, or a specific tag) we use document.querySelectorAll.\n    //change the background of all the paragraph items on our page\n    var paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p');\n    for(var i=0; i\nWe've learned that style and innerText are properties of DOM elements. Image tags can also have width and height.\nWhile it's really easy to change styles directly on elements using the style property, it is not usually a good idea to mix JavaScript and CSS (see separation of concerns in the first lesson). To solve this, we can use the className property to set the class for an element instead of changing its styles directly:\n//before: \nvar container = document.querySelector('#myContainer');\ncontainer.className = \"largeBlock\";\n//after: \n\nTo get the text from an Input field:\nvar updateTitleBtn = document.querySelector('#updateTitleBtn');\n\nupdateTitleBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {\n    var inputBox = document.querySelector('#titleInput');\n    var title = inputBox.value;\n\n    var titleElement = document.querySelector('#lessonTitle');\n    titleElement.innerText = title;\n    inputBox.value = title;\n});\n\nThe above waits for click on a button. When the button is clicked, it gets the input box element (inputBox variable).\nTo get the entered text from it, we use the value property: var title = inputBox.value.\nAJAX\nClient/Server architecture\nA server is a device or program that provides functionality to other programs or devices. There are database servers, mail servers, game servers, etc. The vast majority of these servers are accessed over the internet. They can take the form of industrial server farms that provide a service to millions of users (used by Facebook, Google, etc.), to personal servers for storing your files.\nThe server communicates with clients. A client can be a web browser, a Slack app, your phone, etc.\nClient–server systems use the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.\n\nHTTP Requests\nA server stores the data, and the client (other programs or computers) requests data or sends some of its own. But how do they talk to each other?\nFor the client and the server to communicate they need an established language (a protocol). Which is what HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is for. It defines the methods you can use to communicate with a server and indicate your desired actions on the resources of the server.\nThere are two main types of requests: GET and POST.\n\n\n\nRequest type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGET\nAsk for a specified resource (e.g. show me that photo)\n\n\nPOST\nSend content to the server (e.g. post a photo)\n\n\n\nHTTP is the language of the internet. In our case we're using Javascript, but you can send HTTP requests with other laguages as well.\nWhat is AJAX?\nAJAX is a technique for implementing client-server communication in the browser.\nTypically, the server holds the data, and only sends it to the client (web page) when there's a request. AJAX requests are sent after the page has loaded, usually in response to an action by the user. For example when the user clicks a button, some JavaScript will trigger an AJAX request to fetch data.\nIntroduction to Fetch and asynchronous code\nfetch is a way of creating HTTP requests in JavaScript.\nfetch('https://codeyourfuture.herokuapp.com/api/hello')\n    .then(function(response) {\n        return response.text(); // or response.json()\n    })\n    .then(function(text) {\n        console.log(text); // Print 'Hello CodeYourFuture!'\n    });\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo contains few challenges - solve all the pending exercises in week-5 and week-5-practise.\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-09/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-09/lesson.html","title":"Week 9 - More JS in the Browser","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core II - 3\n\nMore JS in the Browser\nFork, clone and follow the instructions on the Dom-AJAX workshop repo\nHomework\nContinue the pending tasks on the Dom-AJAX workshop repo.\n"},"js-core-3/":{"url":"js-core-3/","title":"JavaScript III","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core 3\nExample structure:\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\n\n\n\n\n1\nJSON  HTTP, AJAX, APIS\n\n\n2\nPromises  fetch\n\n\n3\nClasses and Object Oriented Programming\n\n\n\n"},"js-core-3/week-10/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-10/lesson.html","title":"Week 10 - Unit Tests and TDD","keywords":"","body":"\nJS Core III - 1\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nTracing Code\nTesting\nUnit Testing\nUnit Testing Frameworks - JEST\nTest-driven Development\nMore on Testing\nTest coverage\nRefactoring\nModules\n\n\n\n\nFork and Clone the js-exercises-tdd repo\n\nTracing Code\nWhat is Code? Computer code is a set of rules or instructions. It is made up of words and numbers and when you put them in the right order it will tell your computer what you want it to do. \nLet's trace these code samples together:\n\nSample 1 \n\nSample 2 \n\nSample 3 \n\n\nTesting our code\nWe have just traced the output of some code on paper, but how do ensure that the code actually does what it is supposed to do when we run it.\n\nDiscussion: How have we been testing our code so far? How do ensure it is correct. What is \"correct\" anyhow?\n\nIn many organisations, there are full teams dedicated to testing and ensuring that the code written behaves correctly, to report bugs and make sure that they are fixed on time. In general, Quality Assurance is a responsibility of everyone in a team starting from Project Manager, Scrum Masters, Developers and Testers.\nThere are typically several levels of testing when working on a project:\n\nUnit testing\nIntegration testing\nFunctional, End to End testing and User Acceptance Testing (UAT)\n\nThis answer from Stack OverFlow has a good explanation of types of testing. The defintions for Functional, e2e and UAT are often mean different things in different teams, the responisibility for them also falls on different individuals depending on the team.\nUnit testing though is always the responsibility of the Developer, and it is a very important skill for any professional developer to be able to write tests, and also write code that is testable.\n\nDiscussion: What is testable code?\n\nvar result;\n\nfunction getMentorInfo(mentors, name) {\n    var greeting = 'Hello ';\n\n    result = mentors.find(function (person) {\n        return person.name === name;\n    });\n\n    var mentorTitle = 'Junior Developer';\n\n    if (result.yearsOfExp > 10) {\n        mentorTitle = 'Senior Developer';\n    } else if (result.yearsOfExp > 20) {\n        mentorTitle = 'Very Senior Developer';\n    }\n\n    result.jobTitle = mentorTitle;\n    result.fullName = result.title + ' ' + result.name;\n\n    return result;\n}\n\n/*\n  var mentors = [\n      {\n          name: 'Irina',\n          title: 'Dr.',\n          yearsOfExperience: 10\n      }, {\n          name: 'Ashleigh',\n          title: 'Dame',\n          yearsOfExperience: 20\n      }, {\n          name: 'Etza',\n          title: 'Professor',\n          yearsOfExperience: 30\n      }\n  ];\n\n  var result = getMentorInfo(mentors, 'Etza')\n  Trace the value of \"result\"\n*/\n\nUnit Testing\nTesting is a key skill for any software programmer. We need to make sure our\nsoftware is thoroughly tested, otherwise bad things happen. Testing makes sure\nour programs behave like we intend them to do - if we don't test, we can cause\nsevere bugs. Bad software can make planes crash, companies bankrupt, and users\nof your software really frustrated.\nThere are different levels on which we can test software, for example\nintegration testing, end-to-end testing, and unit testing. Today we will deal\nwith unit testing, which is probably the most universal testing discipline.\nA unit test is exactly that - it tests a unit of code. \"Unit\" can mean\ndifferent things, but in JavaScript it usually refers to a single function.\nRemember when we talked about functions? Functions take input (as arguments),\ndo something with it (in the function body), and return output (using the\nreturn statement). Ideally, a function should always return the same output if\nthe same input is given. It makes it predictable and testable - and that's what\nwe want!\n         |-----------------|\ninput => | doing something | => output\n         |-----------------|\nSo, when unit testing a function, we want to make sure that for a certain\ninput, we get the expected output. For this we need to make sure that the\noutput matches our expectations. In the simplest form that means we do an\nequality check:\nmyFunction(input) === expectedOutput;\n\nWe can formalise this using another function that compares two values and\ncomplains when they do not match. Such a function is prepared in\nunit-testing/equals.js.\nWe can use this function to simply compare to values:\nequals(1, 1); // This should pass\nequals(1, 2); // This should fail\nequals(\"Hello\", \"Hello\"); // This should pass\n\nNow we can use this equals() function to test our own code by comparing a\nfunction result to an expected value.\nRemember that one function can be used as an argument when a second function is called. In this instance, the function we are testing would represent our first function, and our equals() function would represent the second, like so...\nequals(myNewFunction(arg1, arg2, etc), expectedOutput)\n\nAs you can see in this example, instead of using a number as the first argument to the equals() function, we have used a function instead; the one we wish to test.\n\nExercise: Write tests for the the exercises under I.write-tests\n\nUnit testing frameworks\nThere are lots of other things you might want to test for than two things being\nequal. You might want to test if a number is smaller or greater than another, if\na function was called, if an error happened, or if one thing happened before\nanother thing, or how long a function call took to execute.\nWe don't have to build all these things ourselves. Instead there are unit\ntesting frameworks that take all that work off our shoulders. All we need to do\nis provide the code and the tests.\nJest\nThe unit testing framework we are trying to day is called\nJest. It's created by Facebook and useful\nfor all kinds of unit testing (especially testing React, which we will do in a\nlater lesson).\nLook into your jest/ folder. You will find a file there, sum.test.js. The\nsuffix .test.js tells Jest that this file contains tests it should execute. To\nexecute the test, run the following command in your terminal:\nnpm test\n\nThis command runs the test in sum.test.js, which tests the sum() function.\nYou can see the test output and the fact that the test passed.\nTests cases in Jest have the following structure:\ntest(\"test description\", function() {\n  // Test instructions\n});\n\nJest provides a set of functions that you can use to write your actual tests.\nThey are created in a way that imitates natural language, for example:\n_Expect_ sum of 1 and 2 _to be_ 3\nbecomes\nexpect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n\nYou can add multiple test statements in the same test case (a test case is one\ncall of the test function, but you can also create multiple test cases in one\nfile. It is important that you give all your test cases meaningful descriptions.\n\nExercise: Add another test case to sum.test.js. Is the sum of 10 and -10\nreally zero? Run the tests using Jest.\nExercise: Take the findNeedle function you have tested previously, copy it\ninto the jest/ folder and call it findNeedle.test.js. Then write a test to\nbe used with Jest, similar to sum.test.js. Make sure you cover multiple\ninputs and give all tests meaningful descriptions! Run the tests using Jest.\n\nTest Driven Development\nTest-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. [Wikipedia]\nWhen developing following TDD, you normally follow this sequence:\n\nAdd a test\nRun all tests and see if the new test fails (Red)\nWrite the simplest code to make the test pass (Green)\nRefactor\nRepeat\n\nRead more on the Wikipedia article and the resources at the end.\nRed Green Refactor\n\nExercise: Two mentors pair on a problem doing \"ping pong\" TDD. One writing the test, the other writing the implementation.\n\nMore on Testing\nTest coverage\nTest coverage describes the extent to which a code base is tested. When Jest\nruns your tests, it generates a so-called coverage report. This report tells\nyou how many of your lines of code are covered by tests, how many functions,\nstatements, and branches.\n\nA branch is one of multiple ways a code control flow can go. For example, if\nyou have an if() ... else ..., both the \"if\" and the \"else\" branch must be\ncovered by tests.\n\nWe want to keep our code coverage as high as possible. Jest allows us to\ngenerate a coverage report when we run the following command in the terminal:\nnpm test -- --coverage\n\n\nExercise: Check your code coverage for the tests you wrote. Is any of the\nnumbers below 100%? If so, try and bring it up to 100%!\n\nRefactoring\nThere are times when we want to make our code better without changing any\nfunctionality, for example because we just learnt about a better way to solve a\ncertain problem (like, finding needles in haystacks). This is called\nrefactoring.\nWhen previously GREEN code - working code! - suddenly does not work anymore,\nwe call this a regression. Our existing tests can make sure that when we\nrefactor, the functionality of our code actually stays the same, and does not\nregress.\n\nExercise: Refactor some of the exercise we've written tests for.\n\nModules\nSo far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs\ncan become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be\nmaintainable.\nWe can therefore split our code into so-called modules. A module is basically\na JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and\nprograms.\nCreating modules, exporting code\nIt is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module\nby exporting its functionality:\nfunction printName(name) {\n  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = printName;\n\nThe key here is the line containing module.exports. As you see, this is an\nassignment, and whatever is assigned to module.exports will be made available\nto other modules and program when this file is imported.\nUsing modules, importing code\nBut how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to import it,\nand this is done using a function called require().\n\nThere are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here,\nwhich is natively supported by Node, is called CommonJS.\n\nvar printName = require(\"./printName.js\");\n\n\nThe string passed to the require() function is a path to the file you are\nimporting. ./ signifies the current directory, so the above command will\nimport a file called \"printName.js\" that is in the same directory as our\nprogram.\n\nAssuming our program is in the same folder as printName.js, we can use the\nabove code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in\nthe printName variable.\nWe can then continue to use the printName function as if it we defined it in\nour own program!\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\nprintName();\n\nModules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already\nlearned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing\nmultiple functions.\nTogether: Edit the file modules/main.js and follow the instructions.\n\nSeparating code and tests\nExporting and importing modules is really useful for testing, too.\nAs a rule of thumb, we never want to mix our actual code with our tests. It is\ntherefore common to put them in separate files. We are going to call the file\ncontaining the tests after the file containing the code to be tested, just\nappending .test at the end of the filename. Like so:\nmain.js               # Our main program\nmain.test.js          # Tests for our main program\nsomeOtherCode.js      # A module called \"someOtherCode\"\nsomeOtherCode.test.js # Tests for the \"someOtherCode\" module\n\nThe naming is really up to convention - you can even put your tests in a\ndifferent folder! However, for Jest it is important to call test files\n\"*.test.js\".\n\nGlossary\nYou should know these terms by the end of this class: Testing, Quality Assurance, Unit Tests, Integration Tests, Refactoring, Regression Tests .. any more?\nResources\n\nJavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford, chapter 4 - Functions\nMDN Objects basics\nMDN OOP in JS\nTest-driven development\nJest\nModules\nSetup VS Code for Debugging\n\nTracing code resources\nCheck out these videos.

Use Chrome Developer Tools to find out what is causing these issues.\nFollow this tutorial about Debugging with Chrome\nThe terms \"bug\" and \"debugging\" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s.[1] While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were \"debugging\" the system\n\nGood Design\nDesign is important if we want our code to be understandable (both to other\nhumans, but also to us in the future), to be easy to use and easy to expand.\nThere are three main principles you need to know now: clarity, reusability and\nextensibility. There are also others, but they are deeply related to these\nthree.\n\nEase of Maintenance / Clarity\n\nNaming\nCommenting\nClear logic\nConcise\nFormatting\nAvoiding Redundancy\n\n\nReusability\n\nDRY\nSingle Reponsibility\nAvoiding global state (scope)\nPredictability and Ease of testing\n\n\n\n\nExtensibility\n\nAvoiding being unnecessarily specific (e.g. magic numbers)\n\n\n\nNow let's take a look at a bigger example of a badly written function\nfunction myFunction(salary, taxCode, incomeTax1, incomeTax2, ownsCar) {\n  var totalIncomeTax = incomeTax1 + incomeTax2;\n  var studentLoan = (salary - 17775) * 0.09;\n  var originalSalary = salary;\n  var nationalInsurance = null;\n\n  if (taxCode === \"1150L\") {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.1;\n  } else if (taxCode === \"ST\") {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.05;\n  } else {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.08;\n  }\n\n  var deductions = [nationalInsurance, totalIncomeTax, studentLoan];\n\n  salary = salary - deductions[0];\n  salary = salary - deductions[1];\n  salary = salary - deductions[2];\n\n  return (\n    \"Your gross income is £\" +\n    originalSalary.toString() +\n    \" and your net income is £\" +\n    salary.toString() +\n    \".\"\n  );\n}\n\nconsole.log(myFunction(28000, \"1150L\", 1000, 580, false));\n\nWhat is wrong with this function?\n\nNaming: the function has a bad name, myFunction() tells you nothing about\nwhat the function does. It's also considered bad practice to name variables\nvaguely by separating them through numbers (incomeTax1, incomeTax2, etc). If\nyou find yourself doing this then you should either use an array (such as\nincomeTax[]).\n\nCommenting: the function isn't documented at all. It's very difficult to\nunderstand what the function's purpose is and how each part of the code\ncontributes to it. By writing comments, the coder communicates their\nreasoning and helps the function be human readable.\n\nLayout/formatting: unnecessary spacing between the if and else statement.\n\nSingle responsibility: the function doesn't have a single purpose. It\ncalculates national insurance and salary deductions. Maybe the national\ninsurance calculation could be moved to a separate function.\n\nInput variable being overwritten: the function requires gross salary (before\ndeductions) and net salary (after deductions) the salary input variable is\ntherefore copied into an originalSalary variable so that it can be changed.\nIt would be much clearer to create a new netSalary variable and leave\nsalary unmodified.\n\nDRY principle: the function validates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule.\nThe line where a deduction is taken from the salary is repeated 3 times with\ndifferent indices. This can be replaced with a for loop.\n\nMagic numbers. The code contains a lot of magic numbers, including 17775,\n0.09 and 0.1.\n\nUseless parameters: the code contains a variable which isn't used. They\nshould be removed because they are confusing. It is tempting when you're\nstarting to code a function to add more parameters thinking that you might\nneed them, but it's important to remove them if you don't end up using them.\n\n\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, go through all of these issues and make\nappropriate improvements to the code.\n\nAsync vs Sync\nToDO: Trace async code on paper\n\nDifferent ways of doing async in JavaScript\n\nIntro to ES6\nECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) is a significant update to JavaScript that introduces\nnew syntax for writing complex applications. \nconst and let\nYou have already come across the var keyword as a way to create new variables.\nThe let and const keywords are also used for variable creation, but the\nvariables created using these keywords have different scope. Var has \"function\nscope\", whereas let and const have \"block scope\".\n\nExercise: This badly designed function will throw the error message is\nnot defined. What is the problem, and how could we fix it?\n\nfunction compareNumbers(m, n) {\n  if (m \nThe const keyword is similar to let, the only difference is that a variable\ndeclared using const can't be changed after it is assigned.\n\nExercise: What advantages might a block scope variable have over a function\nscope variable? In what situation might you want to use const instead of a\nvariable that can be re-assigned?\nExercise: Let's update this code to use let and const instead of var\n\nfunction getCircleArea(radius) {\n  var pi = Math.PI;\n  var rSquared = Math.pow(radius, 2);\n\n  return pi * rSquared;\n}\n\nfunction getCircleAreas(radiusArr) {\n  var areasArr = [];\n\n  for (var i = 0; i \nTemplate literals\nWe do a lot of string concatenation in JavaScript - ES6 introduces a more\nelegant way of accomplishing the same.\nfunction greeting(name) {\n  return \"Hello \" + name + \", welcome to JS core 3!\";\n}\n\nRewriting this function in ES6, we have\nfunction greeting(name) {\n  return `Hello ${name}, welcome to JS core 3!`;\n}\n\nArrow functions\nES6 also has a new way of declaring functions. Let's see how it works.\n// before \nfunction sum(a, b, c) {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\n// ES6\nconst sum = (a, b, c) => {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\nIf the function only contains one expression, the curly braces and the return \nare optional and we can write the whole function in one line. \nconst sum = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;\n\n\nExercise: Refactor the previous code to have a separate function that checks\nif gender is 'female' or not, and use it in sayGreeting. Let's try and make\nthe code as compact as possible together using ES6 features.\n\nDefault parameters\nES6 allows us to declare defaults for function arguments. The default value is \nused when the argument/parameter is either missing or undefined. \nThis function returns the sum of three numbers. Let's assume we want to use the \nsame function with only two arguments: \n// without default parameter\nconst sum = (a, b, c) => {\n  c = c || 0;\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 3, 4)) // 8\nconsole.log(sum(2, 5)) // NaN\n\n// with default parameter \nconst sum = (a, b, c = 0) => {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\nconsole.log(sum(2, 5)) // 7\n\nDestructuring\nIn ES6 we can extract data from objects or arrays using destructuring. \n// before \nvar chicken = {\n  name: 'Maggie', \n  age: 2\n}\n\nvar name = chicken.name;\nvar age = chicken.age;\n\nvar numbers = [1, 2];\n\nvar firstNumber = numbers[0];\nvar secondNumber = numbers[1];\n\n\n// in ES6\nconst chicken = {\n  name: 'Maggie', \n  age: 2\n}\n\nconst { name, age } = chicken;\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2];\n\nconst [firstNumber, secondNumber] = numbers;\n\nResources\n\nES6 features\nLet and const\n\nHomework\n\nFinish the Katas in js-exercises-tdd\n\n[Optional] Clone the repo of the\nelection project and work on the tasks in the instructions.\n\nPrepare for the exam and finish all pending homework: js-exercises, js-exercises-tdd and dom-ajax\n\n\n"},"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html","title":"Week 12 - Recap","keywords":"","body":"\nTo Be Agreed\nJS Core III\n What we will learn today?\n\nTopic 1\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nTopic 4\n\n\nTopic 1\nHigh level explanation of Topic 1 - rely on the exercises\n\nExercise: Always have exercises\n\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nResources\n\nResource 1 to learn more about Topic 1\nResource 2 for Topic 2\n\nHomework\n\nFirst part of Homework - Easy\n\nSecond part of Homework - Intermediate/Hard\n\n[Bonus/Optional] Third part/optional - Hardest\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nRead this Some Tutorial or Video etc...\n\n"},"react/":{"url":"react/","title":"React","keywords":"","body":"React\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\nHomework\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1\nReact 101\nReact 101 Homework\n\n\nWeek 2\nReacting to Changes\nReacting to Changes Homework\n\n\nWeek 2\nFetching Data\nFetching Data Homework\n\n\nWeek 4\nRouting (optional)\n\n\n\n"},"react/week-1/lesson.html":{"url":"react/week-1/lesson.html","title":"Week 13 - React 101","keywords":"","body":"React 1\n\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nWhat is React?\nWhat is a component?\nRendering with React\nJSX\nLet's Create a React App\nReact Components\nEmbedding JS into JSX\nKey\nImporting/Exporting Components\nMaking an Argument for Props\nWhat Are Props?\n\nWhat is React?\nReact is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. It is used for making complex, interactive user interfaces. It has become very popular in the last 5 years.\nWhy has it become so popular?\n\nIt is fast and efficient\nIt is easy to understand & less verbose than \"vanilla\" JS api\nIt helps separate functionality into small, understandable pieces\n\nWhat is a component?\nReact heavily relies on a concept called \"components\". Components are like small Lego blocks for designing and developing user interfaces. They can be stuck together in different ways to create new UI.\nLet's have a look at an example: the GitHub header. What are the logical \"pieces\" of UI? What could be a component?\n\nHere we've highlighted some elements that could be components:\n\nComponent tips\nThere are no hard & fast rules for making components. UIs can be split up into components in many different ways, requiring judgement based on your context.\n\nComponents should follow the Single Responsibility Principle\nEach component should only have 1 \"responsibility\"\nShould only do 1 thing\n\n\nComponents should have good, explicit names\nThis helps you to remember what the component's job is\n\n\n\n\nExercise A:\nLook at the example online shopping user interface in the Thinking in React article (the image at the top). Draw boxes around the components and give them names. Compare with the example components shown in the second image.\n\nRendering with React\nRemember how annoying it was to manage the DOM yourself in our previous lesson? The \"vanilla\" JavaScript APIs for updating the DOM are quite long and difficult to remember. React makes this easier by manipulating each DOM element itself, instead of you doing it manually. You give React a \"description\" of the DOM that you want and it will update the DOM for you. React abstracts away the management of the DOM.\nLet's take a look at an example. We are going to walk through how to render a  with the text \"Hello World\" within it.\nFirst, lets recap how we could do this using \"vanilla\" JS (interactive version):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  var divNode = document.createElement('div');\n  divNode.innerText = 'Hello World';\n\n  var rootElement = document.querySelector('#root');\n  rootElement.appendChild(divNode);\n\n\n\n\nNow let's convert to using React (interactive version):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  const element = React.createElement('div', {\n    children: 'Hello World'\n  });\n\n  const rootElement = document.querySelector('#root');\n  ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement);\n\n\n\n\nJSX\nAs you can see, React is already helping us a bit by cleaning up some of the verbose vanilla JS APIs. However in a typical React application you would still use a lot of the React.createElement function. To improve the developer experience the React team developed JSX.\nJSX is a simple syntax sugar that looks like HTML, but is actually converted to the React.createElement function when you run it.\nUsing JSX (interactive version):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  const element = Hello World;\n\n  const rootElement = document.querySelector('#root');\n  ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement);\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this is much easier to read than both the straight React.createElement API and the vanilla JS API. Most people using React use JSX to write their components.\n\nExercise B\nChange the JSX example from above to instead render a h1 tag with the text \"Hello Code Your Future\".\n\nLet's Create A React App\nThe Facebook team behind React have created a tool to help you create and set up React projects. It is called Create React App. It sets up files like we saw in the previous example, so that you don't have to.\n\nExercise C: Install & set up a Create React App by following the steps below\n\nnpm install -g create-react-app\n\ncreate-react-app pokedex\ncd pokedex\nnpm start\nThe last command should open a web browser for you. This shows the application that we are going to be working on. Open the pokedex directory in your editor. Notice that create-react-app has created a bunch of folders for you. We will be working with the pokedex application for the rest of the module.\nReact Components\nWe looked at the beginning of the lesson at the concept of components. Now let's look at how components are made in React.\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nfunction HelloWorld() {\n  return (\n    Hello World\n  );\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.querySelector('#root'));\n\nThere are 3 important parts in this code:\n\nFirst we import React. This is important because JSX is converted to React.createElement calls. If the React variable is undefined then this will fail.\nWe create a React component called HelloWorld.\nWe render the HelloWorld component into a div with the id of root.\n\n\nExercise D:\nUsing the pokedex React app that you just created and open the src/App.js file\n\nDelete everything in the file except the line containing export default App. You should see an error in your terminal and in your web browser - don't panic! We're going to remake the App component ourselves\nImport React variable from the React package\nCreate a function named App, which will be our component\nWithin the App function, return a  element with the text \"Welcome to the Pokedex\". What do you see in your web browser?\nCreate a  element that wraps around the  you just created\nBelow the  element (but within the ), create an  element. Then make its src attribute equal to https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/016.png. What do you expect to see in your web browser?\nNow create a  element to wrap both the  element and the  element\n\n\nComponent Composition\nA component can be combined with another component so that both are rendered. This is called composition (interactive example):\nfunction Greeting() {\n  return Hello;\n}\n\nfunction Mentor() {\n  return Ali;\n}\n\nfunction HelloWorld() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nIn the HelloWorld component we are using a reference to the Greeting and Mentor components. React reads these references when rendering HelloWorld and so it renders the Greeting and Mentor child components.\nWe are also using some shorter syntax within the HelloWorld component.  is just a shorter way of writing , which is useful if we don't need to put anything inside the Greeting component.\nNotice how the components that we write (HelloWorld, Greeting, Mentor) are written using a camel case convention and always start with an uppercase letter? And \"regular DOM\" components (div, span) are always lowercase? This the convention to let you know whether you are using a \"regular DOM component\" or a component that you have written.\n\nExercise E:\nUsing the pokedex React app that you created earlier and open the src/App.js file\n\nCreate a new function named Logo\nCopy  element and its contents and paste into the Logo component\nReplace the  element in the App component with the new Logo component\nCreate a new component function named BestPokemon and return a  element with some text saying which is your favourite Pokemon (e.g. \"My favourite Pokemon is Squirtle\")\nRender your new BestPokemon component below the Logo component within the App component\n\n\nArrow Functions for shorter syntax\nBecause a React component is just a function, we can also use the arrow function syntax:\nconst HelloWorld = () => {\n  return (\n    Hello World\n  );\n}\n\nThis can be even shorter again if we use parentheses and implicit return:\nconst HelloWorld = () => (\n  Hello World\n);\n\nAlthough this is shorter, it is less flexible as we cannot insert code that is not JSX. Like for example, a console.log:\n// THIS DOES NOT WORK!\nconst HelloWorld = () => (\n  console.log('Hello!')\n  Hello world\n);\n\nIf we want to do this, we can still use arrow functions but we can't use the implicit return.\n\nExercise F:\nUsing the pokedex React app that you created earlier and open the src/App.js file\nConvert the Logo and BestPokemon functions into an arrow functions\n\nEmbedding JavaScript into JSX\nSo far all of the components we have looked at haven't been able to change - they are hard-coded. But this doesn't make very interesting websites, we want to be able to use variables with different data. We can insert variables (and some other things) into our React components.\nAnything that is inside curly braces ({ and }) is interpreted as a regular JavaScript expression. That means you can use every object or function from JavaScript that we have learned so far. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nconst Greeting = () => {\n  const greetingWord = 'Hello';\n  return (\n    {greetingWord}\n  );\n}\n\nNow instead of hard-coding the greeting in the Greeting component, we are using a variable. Remember that everything between the curly braces is just regular JavaScript. So we can use more than just variables (interactive example):\nconst Mentor = () => {\n  const mentors = ['Ali', 'Kash', 'Davide', 'German', 'Gerald'];\n  return (\n    {mentors.join(', ')}\n  );\n};\n\nNow we have modified the Mentor component to use the Array.join method so that it lists several mentor's names. This also works with other JS types:\nconst Addition = () => {\n  return {1 + 2 + 3};\n};\n\nconst Weather = () => {\n  const weatherData = {\n    temperature: 5,\n    location: 'London'\n  };\n  return The temperature in {weatherData.location} is {weatherData.temperature};\n};\n\nfunction formatName(user) {\n  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName\n}\n\nconst Name = () => {\n  const user = {\n    firstName: 'Bob',\n    lastName: 'Marley'\n  };\n  return {formatName(user)};\n};\n\nA common pattern in React is to use Array.map to loop through a list of items and render a component for each one (interactive example):\nconst mentors = ['Ali', 'Kash', 'Davide', 'German', 'Gerald'];\n\nconst List = () => (\n  \n    {mentors.map((name) => {\n      return (\n        {name}\n      );\n    })}\n  \n);\n\nHere we are using Array.map to turn an array of strings into an array of components.\n\nExercise G:\nUsing the pokedex React app that you created earlier and open the src/App.js file\n\nInside the Logo component create a new variable called appName and assign it to \"Pokedex\"\nNow replace the hard-coded app name with {appName}. What do you see in your web browser? What would you do if you wanted to change the app name?\nCreate a new component named CaughtPokemon. Within this component return a  tag with the text \"Caught 0 Pokemon on\" (we're going to fill in today's date in the next step)\nCreate a variable named date within the CaughtPokemon component, and assign it today's date (hint: new Date().toLocaleDateString()). Finally, render the date variable after the text \"Caught 0 Pokemon on\"\nRender the CaughtPokemon component within the App component (below BestPokemon)\nWithin the BestPokemon component, create a variable named pokemonNames and assign it to an array with some Pokemon names (e.g. ['Squirtle', 'Bulbasaur', 'Charmander'])\nChange the BestPokemon component to return a  element instead of a  element\nNow use the .map() method on the pokemonNames variable to loop over each name and return a  element for each (hint: look at the mentors list example above)\n\n\nKeys\nYou may have noticed that we are now seeing a red error message in the Dev Tools: Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique \"key\" prop.. This error happens when you use Array.map to return a list of elements (interactive example):\nconst mentors = ['Ali', 'Kash', 'Davide', 'German', 'Gerald']\n\nconst List = () => (\n  \n    {mentors.map((name, index) => {\n      return {name};\n    })}\n  \n);\n\nHere we have added a key prop to the li element. A documentation page explaining in more depth is in the further reading section but basically the key prop has a special meaning in React because it is used internally to keep track of which element in the list is which.\nImporting/Exporting Components\nTo help organise your code, components can be imported and exported just like any other JavaScript code (interactive example):\nimport Greeting from './Greeting';\nimport Mentor from './Mentor';\n\nconst HelloMentor = () => (\n  \n    \n    \n  \n);\n\nWe also need to export our components if we want to use them in other files:\nconst Greeting = () => (\n  Hello\n);\n\nexport default Greeting;\n\nThe convention is to name component files the exactly same as the component (including the capital letter).\n\nExercise H:\nUsing the pokedex React app that you created earlier\n\nCreate a new file within the src directory named Logo.js\nCopy and paste the Logo component from App.js into Logo.js\nRemember to add import React from 'react' at the top of Logo.js\nExport the Logo component from Logo.js (hint: look at the Greeting example above)\nDelete the old Logo component from App.js\nImport the Logo component into App.js (hint: look at the HelloMentor example above)\nRepeat this process with the BestPokemon and CaughtPokemon components. What do you think the files should be called?\n\n\nMaking an Argument for Props\nWhat's the problem with our HelloMentor component above?\nThe component HelloMentor is very static. What if we want to say hello to a different mentor? Currently, we would have to change the code too! This is easy in our tiny application but for \"real\" applications this might be more difficult.\nInstead wouldn't it be good if we could change which mentor we are saying hello to every time we render the component? So we could reuse the HelloMentor component for different mentor names. This is what props are for.\nWhat Are Props?\nProps are what we use in React to pass \"arguments\" to components. They are very similar to arguments in functions - you can \"pass\" props to components, and you can use those props within a component.\nFirst let's look at passing props to your components (interactive example):\n\n\nAs you can see props are key-value pairs, in this example the key is name and the value is the string 'Mozafar'. We can pass as many props as we like to a component.\nWe don't have to use strings, we can use any valid JavaScript data like numbers, arrays and objects. Remember that in JSX you can use curly braces ({ & }) to inject data that is not a string:\n\n\nNow let's take a look at using props that we have passed to a component (interactive example):\nconst Mentor = (props) => {\n  console.log(props);\n  return (\n    {props.name}\n  );\n};\n\nReact gives you access to props in the first argument to the component function. We can then inject props into our component using curly braces.\nThe props variable is just a normal object with key-value pairs that match what was passed to the component. Because it is just a variable, it can be used like any other variable. That includes injecting props into attributes:\n{props.name}\n\nOr calculating new values:\n{props.age + 1}\n\n\nExercise I\nUsing the pokedex React app that you created earlier\n\nOpen the App.js file\nPass a prop appName=\"Pokedex\" to the Logo component\nNow open the Logo.js file\nDelete the appName variable. What do you see in your web browser? Why?\nChange the Logo function to access the first argument and call it props. Use console.log to inspect the props variable\nChange the usage of appName in the  to be props.appName instead. Does this fix the problem? Why?\nNow open the BestPokemon.js file\nCopy the pokemonNames variable and then delete it\nPaste the pokemonNames variable into App.js\nPass the pokemonNames variable as a prop to BestPokemon\nIn the BestPokemon.js file replace the existing usage of pokemonNames with the pokemonNames prop. You should still see the Pokemon names in your web browser\n(STRETCH GOAL) Repeat the process with the date variable in the CaughtPokemon.js file\n\n\nFurther Reading\nFed up of having to provide a prop for every component? Do you want to make your component use a value most of the time, but it can be overridden with a prop? This is a good time to use defaultProps. This page on the React documentation describes in more detail.\n\nExercise J\nComplete the FreeCodeCamp exercises on defaultProps:\n\nUse Default Props\nOverride Default Props\n\n\nCredits\nInspiration & examples for this module were taken from Kent C.

Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\n// Class component\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      Hello\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Functional component\nconst Greeting = () => {\n  return (\n    Hello\n  )\n};\n\nInstead of getting props through the first argument of the component function, the class component gets props from this.props:\nclass Mentor extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      {this.props.name}\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nSo when do we use the class keyword and when do we use function components? Class components have special super powers called state and lifecycle (which we will look at later). The rule of thumb is to use functional components, unless you need to use the special super powers of state or lifecycle.\nHere are the steps to follow to convert from a functional component into a class component:\n\nImport the Component variable by changing the React import to: import React, { Component } from 'react';\nCreate a new class that extends the component: class MyComponentName extends Component {}\nInside the class, create a render method: render() {}\nCopy and paste the contents of the functional component into the render method\nReplace any references to props with this.props\nDelete the old functional component\n\n\nExercise A\nOpen the pokedex React application that you created last week\n\nConvert the Logo component from a functional component into a class component\nConvert the CaughtPokemon component into a class component\nConvert the BestPokemon component into a class component\n\n\nClass Methods\nOne of the super powers that class components have is how we can add more functions within the class scope. These are called methods (interactive example):\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Hello extends Component {\n  sayHello = () => {\n    console.log('Hello from Hello component!');\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      Say hello\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nNotice how we use a slightly different syntax for the sayHello method than the render method? There is a reason for this, but it is quite complicated and mostly irrelevant. The rule of thumb is to always use this syntax:\nmethodName = () => {\n  // ...\n}\n\nExcept for the render method (and a handful of others which we'll talk about later).\n\nExercise B\nOpen the pokedex React application and open the Logo.js file\n\nAdd a method named logWhenClicked to the Logo component (hint: remember to use the correct syntax)\nWithin the logWhenClicked method, console.log a message (it doesn't matter what the message is)\nAdd a onClick handler to the  that will call this.logWhenClicked (hint: look at the Hello component above)\nIn your web browser, try clicking on the image. What do you see in the JavaScript console?\n\n\nPassing Functions as Props\nRemember that functions in JavaScript are \"first class\" - that means we can pass a reference to a function (as a variable) and then call it elsewhere.\nfunction hello() {\n  return 'Hello!';\n}\n\nIn the example above hello is a reference to a function. The functions are not called until we use parentheses:\nconsole.log(hello);   // Logs: \"ƒ hello() {}\"\nconsole.log(hello()); // Logs: \"Hello!\"\n\nThis is important in React as we can pass the reference to the function as a prop, and then call the function from the child component (interactive example):\nclass App extends Component {\n  logWhenClicked = () => {\n    console.log('Button was clicked!');\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst FancyButton = (props) => (\n  \n    Click Me!\n  \n);\n\n\nExercise C\nOpen the pokedex React application\n\nOpen the Logo.js component and copy the logWhenClicked method. Then delete it from the Logo component.\nChange the onClick handler to this.props.handleClick\nPaste the logWhenClicked method into the component in App.js\nThen pass the logWhenClicked method as a prop to the Logo component (hint: look at the App example above)\nTry clicking the image in your web browser again. Does it still work? Can you explain why to the person sitting next to you?\n\n\nReacting to Changes\nNow let's write a more interesting app that responds to some user input. We'll see how React will take care of updating the DOM for you.\nA counter is a common React example, showing the number of times a button has been clicked. First lets render a button and a counter which set to 0 clicks (interactive example):\nlet count = 0;\n\nconst Counter = (props) => (\n  \n    Count: {props.count}\n    Click me!\n  \n);\n\nfunction renderCounter() {\n  ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'));\n}\n\nrenderCounter(count);\n\nNote that this example is simplified compared to your pokedex application. To keep the code clean, some parts are split into separate files. In the pokedex application, you'll find the ReactDOM.render call in index.js.\nThis example isn't very useful yet as it doesn't do anything when clicking the button. Now let's listen for clicks on the button and increment the counter (interactive version):\nlet count = 0\n\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  // ...\n}\nfunction renderCounter(count) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nrenderCounter(count)\n\ndocument.getElementById('click-me').addEventListener('click', () => {\n  count = count + 1\n  renderCounter(count)\n})\n\nAs you can see, the DOM automatically updates when you render. This is an incredibly powerful feature of React. Even better, React will figure out exactly the right bits of the DOM that need to be changed. This makes it extremely efficient and fast. This is concept is called the \"virtual DOM\".\nState\nLet's take another look at the the counter example. What if you wanted to create multiple counters on the same page? How would you add another counter?\nYou could add some more count global variables:\nlet count1 = 0\nlet count2 = 0\nlet count3 = 0\n\nWhat might be the problem here?\n\nIt's quite verbose\nIt's hard to make sure that you're updating the correct counter\nIt's stuck at 3 counters - to add more, we'd have to do more work\n\nWhat other approaches can we take?\nThe solution that React provides for us is called state. It allows a component to \"remember\" some variables. Let's take a look at how we could rewrite the counter with React state.\nLet's start over and get rid of the global variables. Generally having global variables is a bad idea, since it is very easy to create a bug which affects the whole application.\nconst Counter = (props) => {\n  return (\n    \n      Count: {props.count}\n      Click me!\n    \n  )\n};\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'));\n\nNow we need to use one of the class component super powers - state. That means we'll have to convert our Counter component to use a class (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Count: {this.props.count}\n        Click me!\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nNext we'll change the component to use the count from this.state instead of this.props (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Count: {this.state.count}\n        Click me!\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThis code has a bug! this.state is initialised as an empty object, and so this.state.count is undefined. We need to initialise it from props. We can do this in the class constructor (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      count: props.count\n    };\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nNow the counter component is \"remembering\" its count, however it is stuck at 0. Next we'll look at how we change what the component is remembering (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState({\n      count: 1\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Count: {this.state.count}\n        Click me!\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThere's a couple of things happening here. We've added an click handler to the button, which will call the increment function when the button gets clicked. When the increment function is called, it calls this.setState function with the count set to 1.\nthis.setState is a special function provided by React's Component, and it is used to change what the component is \"remembering\". It will also tell React that the old value that is still shown in the DOM is outdated and needs to be updated. This will trigger React to re-render, like we did manually with the renderCounter function.\nNow that we have refactored to use React state, we can easily add multiple counters (interactive example):\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  );\n};\n\nThis still isn't a particular useful application, because we can only still only count to 1! We need to change our Counter component so that it reads the previous state, then adds 1 onto that. We can do this by passing a callback function to this.setState (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState(previousState => {\n      return {\n        count: previousState.count + 1\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can count up as many times as we like! \nSo when do we need to use a callback function for this.setState? If we are computing the new state based on the old state, then we need to use a callback function. Otherwise we can just use an object. This is because React can 'delay' this.setState executing for performance reasons. By using a callback function, we ensure that we are computing the new state with the correct version of the old state and not an outdated one.\nLet's recap what we've learnt about React state:\n\nState is one of the class component super powers - you must use a class component to use state\nWe initialise state in the constructor method by assigning the this.state variable to an object with whatever initial state we want (e.g. { something: 'hello' })\nWe can read or render state by using the this.state variable (e.g. this.state.something)\nWe can change state using the this.setState() method and by passing the piece of state we want to update (e.g. this.setState({ something: 'hi' }))\nIf we need to read the previous state to be able to calculate the new state, then we must use a callback function with this.setState() (e.g. this.setState((previousState) => { return { something: previousState.something + 1 } }))\n\n\nExercise D\nOpen the pokedex React application and open the CaughtPokemon.js file\n\nAdd a constructor method to the CaughtPokemon component and remember to handle props correctly (hint: super(props))\nSet the initial state by assigning this.state in the constructor method to an object. Then make the initial state have 0 caughtPokemon\nChange the CaughtPokemon component to render this.state.caughtPokemon instead of hard-coding 0. Do you expect anything to have changed in your web browser?\nAdd a  with the text \"Catch Pokemon\" to the CaughtPokemon component\nCreate an catchPokemon method within the CaughtPokemon class\nAdd a onClick handler to the  we just created that will call the catchPokemon method\nWithin the catchPokemon method, use this.setState() to change caughtPokemon to 1\nUpdate the catchPokemon method to increase the number of caughtPokemon by 1 every time the button is clicked (hint: we need to use the previous state to calculate the new state)\n\n\nWhen do you use Props or State?\nWe've looked at the 2 main ways of managing data in our React components. But when should we use props and when should we use state?\nRemember that props are like \"arguments\" to a component. It's good practice to make sure that you don't modify arguments after you receive them. In fact, React makes it impossible to modify (or mutate) props. Let's have a look at an example (interactive example):\nclass Hello extends Component {\n  render() {\n    this.props.name = 'Ali';\n\n    return (\n      Hello {this.props.name}\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nrender(, document.getElementById('root'));\n\nYou'll see that we get an error. This is because React has made props read-only, which is a reminder to you that we shouldn't change props. If we were allowed to change props, React doesn't have a way of telling that you've changed the data. Our UI is now stale - not up-to-date with the latest data - and has no way of knowing that it has to re-render.\nFrom this we can get a clue about when to use state. If data changes over time, then we need to use state. My rule of thumb is that I always use props until I know that it needs to change over time, then I convert it to state. As you get more experience with React, you'll know sooner what should be props and what should be state.\nContainer components\nIn real world applications, the things we want to remember in state follow the business logic required by our users. So for example the number of caught Pokemon in the exercise  increases when you click on the button Catch Pokemon. Most of the time, business logic is about figuring out when and how to change state.\nTo help us cleanly split up code that performs business logic from code that shows the user interface we split components into presentational and container components. Often we have components that don't do anything except manage state according to the business rules and render the right presentational components. On the other hand, we often have components that don't change any state, and just render using the provided props.\nContainer components usually have some state and handler methods. Because of this they must use the class syntax. Presentational components on the other hand don't require the more verbose syntax. Instead they usually use the functional syntax.\nFurther Reading\nWhat happens if you forget to pass a prop to a component? Or if you pass the wrong type of data to a component? Sometimes React will just render an empty element but sometimes it could throw an error! This is why propTypes are useful.

However (and this is often the case in large applications), we might want to control whether components are shown or not. Let's look at a Toggle component (interactive example):\nconst Message = () => (\n  I'm shown when this.state.isShown is true ✅\n);\n\nclass Toggle extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { isShown: false };\n  }\n\n  toggle = () => {\n    this.setState((previousState) => { \n        return { isShown: !previousState.isShown } \n     });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.state.isShown ?  : null}\n        Toggle\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nIf you open up dev tools, you will see that the element changes based on the isShown state. The hidden element is not hidden with CSS, it is actually removed from the DOM. This is because this.state.isShown is false which means the Toggle component returns null for that part of the JSX. If you return null in JSX then React will render nothing at all.\nThe Circle of Life\nWhen a component is within the DOM, we call it mounted. When a component is removed from the DOM, we call it unmounted. When we change state like in the unmounting example above, we can switch between these statuses. This gives us a clue that components go through a lifecycle of different statuses. We have seen 2 of the statuses: mounting and unmounting, there is also a third called updating.\nWe can hook into this lifecycle through special component methods that are added by React's Component class. They are run at different points of the lifecycle, often before and after they change to a different status. The method names contain will or did based on whether they run before or after a status change.\nThis diagram shows the React component lifecycle:\n\nLet's look at how we can use one of the lifecycle methods (interactive example):\nclass Lifecycle extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    console.log('componentDidMount');\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return Hello World;\n  }\n}\n\n\nExercise A\nOpen the pokedex application that we have been working on for the last 2 weeks and open the CaughtPokemon.js file\n\nAdd a constructor method to the CaughtPokemon component. Within this method add a console.log('constructor')\nAdd a componentDidMount method to the CaughtPokemon component. Within this method add a console.log('componentDidMount'). You don't need to return anything from this method\nRepeat the same step above with the componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount methods\nTry interacting with the CaughtPokemon component in your web browser (clicking the button) while looking at the JavaScript console. What order do the logs appear?\nThe componentWillUnmount method will never be called. Can you explain why?\n\n\nWe'll now focus on a few of the lifecycle hooks and see how they are used.\ncomponentDidMount and componentWillUnmount\nThe componentDidMount method runs after a component has finished rendering to the DOM. The component is now waiting for a props change or input from the user. It is called only once. We use this lifecycle hook to make changes outside of the component (sometimes these are called side effects).\nThe componentWillUnmount method runs when a component has been unmounted from the DOM. It is used to \"clean up\" the component as it is no longer being shown. Often we need to close down or cancel the changes we made in componentDidMount.\nTo look at these in more detail, we'll create a Clock component in an exercise.\n\nExercise B\nOpen the pokedex React application again\n\nCreate a new file called Clock.js in the src directory\nCopy and paste in the code below (interactive version):\n\n\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Time extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { date: new Date() };\n  }\n\n  tick = () => {\n    console.log('tick');\n    this.setState({\n      date: new Date()\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass Clock extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { isShowingClock: true };\n  }\n\n  toggle = () => {\n    this.setState((previousState) => {\n      return { isShowingClock: !previousState.isShowingClock };\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.state.isShowingClock && }\n        Toggle time\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Clock;\n\n\n\nIn App.js import the Clock component with import Clock from './Clock'\nThen render the Clock component in the App component (hint: )\nNow change the Time component (notice that there are 2 components defined in this file) add a componentDidMount method\nWithin the componentDidMount method use setInterval to call this.tick every 1000 milliseconds (hint: setInterval(this.tick, 1000))\nNow open the JavaScript console your web browser. What is happening? Can you explain why?\nKeep looking at the JavaScript console and try clicking the \"Toggle time\" button. What do you think the problem is here? How can we fix it?\nChange the componentDidMount method to assign this.timer to the output of setInterval (hint: this.timer = setInterval(this.tick, 1000))\nAdd a componentWillUnmount method to the Time component\nIn the componentWillUnmount method, remove the timer by calling clearInterval(this.timer)\nTry clicking the \"Toggle time\" button again, like in step 9. How have we solved the problem?\n\n\nFetching Data in React\nMost web applications will load data from the server. How do we do this in React? The component lifecycle is very important - we don't want to be calling our API at the wrong time, or multiple times with the same data!\nIf we tried to fetch data in our render method, it would make a request every time props or state changed. This would create lots of unnecessary requests. As we saw above, componentDidMount is called only once when the component is first rendered and so it is an ideal place for making requests. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nclass MartianPhotoFetcher extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(`https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${this.props.date}`);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // We don't don't what the img src is when we render :(\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\nThis example isn't very useful! We can't use the data returned from the server in render because the request is asynchronous :( We need React to re-render once the request is resolved - a perfect use for state! Let's look at an example (interactive example)\nclass MartianPhotoFetcher extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      imgSrc: null\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(`https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${this.props.date}`)\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        this.setState({\n          imgSrc: data.photos[0].img_src\n        })\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can see the Martian photo that we fetched from the server!\nHowever we have a bit of a problem - when we first render the component, we don't have the photo src yet. We first have to initialise it to null in the constructor. This shows us that we're missing something from our UI - a loading status.\nLet's look at showing a different UI when the request is loading (interactive example):\nclass MartianPhotoFetcher extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      isLoading: true,\n      imgSrc: null\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(`https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${this.props.date}&api_key=gnesiqnKCJMm8UTYZYi86ZA5RAnrO4TAR9gDstVb`)\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        this.setState({\n          isLoading: false,\n          imgSrc: data.photos[0].img_src\n        })\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.isLoading) {\n      return Loading... &#x1F47D;;\n    } else {\n      return ;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHere are the steps that the component takes:\n\nInitialise isLoading to true\nIn render, show a loading message because isLoading is true\nOnce rendered, componentDidMount will trigger the API request\nWhen the request resolves, we set the isLoading state to false and set the data that we want\nChanging state triggers a re-render, and because isLoading is false we render the Martian photo\n\nWe can still improve our component! What happens if we make a request that fails? Our request will error, but we won't show the error in the browser. Let's see how we can fix it (interactive example).\nFirst we have to deal with annoying quirk of fetch - it doesn't reject the promise on HTTP errors. We can fix this by adding another .then before we convert to JSON:\n.then((res) => {\n  if (res.status >= 200 && res.status \nNow we can add our solution - a .catch on the fetch call. Here we reset the loading state and add the error to state.\n.catch((err) => {\n  this.setState({\n    isLoading: false,\n    err: err\n  });\n})\n\nNow we can check if there's an error in state and render out an error message:\nrender() {\n  if (this.state.isLoading) {\n    return Loading... &#x1F47D;;\n  } else if (this.state.error) {\n    return Something went wrong &#x1F62D;;\n  } else {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\n\nExercise C\nOpen the pokedex React application again and open the src/BestPokemon.js file\n\nIf you haven't already, convert the BestPokemon component to a class component\nCreate a constructor method (hint: remember to call super(props))\nSet the initial state to have a key named pokemonNames that is assigned to an empty array []\nAdd a componentDidMount method to the component\nWithin the componentDidMount method call the fetch() function with this URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokedex/1/. What will this do?\nAdd a .then() handler into the fetch function (hint: remember this needs to come immediately after the fetch() call) which converts the response from JSON (hint: .then(res => res.json()))\nAdd a second .then() handler after the one we just added, where the callback function will receive an argument called data\nWithin the second .then() callback function, log out the data that we just received (hint: console.log(data.pokemon_entries[0].pokemon_species.name))\nNow change the console.log() to log out an array instead, with the first, fourth and seventh Pokemon (hint: console.log([data.pokemon_entries[0].pokemon_species.name, data.pokemon_entries[3].pokemon_species.name, data.pokemon_entries[6].pokemon_species.name]))\nNow again within the .then() callback function, call this.setState() to set the pokemonNames key and assign it to the array that we just logged out (you can copy/paste it)\nInside the render method, remove the old pokemonNames variable and replace it with this.state.pokemonNames. What do you see in your web browser?\nAdd an isLoading piece of state, which is initialised to true\nWhen calling this.setState() inside the .then() handler, also set isLoading to false\nIn the render method check if this.state.isLoading is true and return a loading message (e.g. Loading...). Otherwise if this.state.isLoading is false then render the loop as we did before\n(STRETCH GOAL) Add some error handling which renders an error message\n(STRETCH GOAL) Explore the data returned from the API. See if you can show some more interesting Pokemon information in your app (hint: try console.logging different data returned from the API)\n\n\nWorking with forms in React\nModern web applications often involve interacting with forms such as creating an account, adding a blog post or posting a comment. This would involve using inputs, buttons and various form elements and being able to get the values entered by users to do something with it (like display them on a page or send them in a POST request). So, how do we do this in React?\nA popular pattern for building forms and collect user data is the controlled component pattern. A pattern is a repeated solution to a problem that is useful in multiple similar cases. Let's have a look at an example (interactive example):\nclass SimpleReminder extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      reminder: \"\"\n    };\n  }\n\n  handleChange = event => {\n    this.setState({\n      reminder: event.target.value\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        Today I need to remember to... {this.state.reminder}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nWe're controlling the value of the input by using the value from the reminder state. This means that we can only change the value by updating the state. It is done using the onChange attribute and the method handleChange which is called every time the input value changes (typically when a new character is added or removed). If you didn't call this.setState() in the handleChange method, then the input's value would never change and it would appear as if you couldn't type in the input! Finally, the value we keep in the reminder state is displayed on the screen as today's reminder. \nIn addition, instead of just saving the value of the input in the state, we could have also transformed the string before we set it with this.setState(), for example by calling toUpperCase() on the string.\nLet's have a look at a more complex example where we want to build a form to let users enter information to create a personal account (interactive example):\nclass CreateAccountForm extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      username: \"\",\n      email: \"\",\n      password: \"\"\n    };\n  }\n\n  handleChange = event => {\n    this.setState({\n      [event.target.name]: event.target.value\n    });\n  };\n\n  submit = () => {\n    console.log(\"Do something with the form values...\");\n    console.log(`Username = ${this.state.username}`);\n    console.log(`Email = ${this.state.email}`);\n    console.log(`Password = ${this.state.password}`);\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create account\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nWe now have three different inputs named username, email and password, and we keep each entered value in a state with the same name. The method handleChange is reused to keep track of each change of value. The trick here is to use the name of the input element to update the corresponding state. Finally, when the user clicks on the submit button, the submit method is called to process the values. They are currently just displayed in the console but you could imagine validating the format of these values and sending them in a POST request.\nAdditional note: Have you seen this strange syntax in the setState of handleChange? It's called a computed property name. In a Javascript object, you can use a variable wrapped in square brackets which acts as a dynamic key, such as: \nconst myFirstKey = \"key1\";\nconst myFirstValue = \"value1\";\nconst dynamicKeyObject = { [myFirstKey]: myFirstValue };\nconsole.log(dynamicKeyObject); // => { key1: \"value1\" }\n\nExercise D\nOpen the pokedex React application again and open the src/CaughtPokemon.js file. In this exercise, instead of recording the number of caught Pokemons, we are going to record the names of each Pokemon you caught.\n\nMake sure the CaughtPokemon component is written as a class component\nAdd an  in the render method before the button (hint: )\nAdd a value property to the  set to the state pokemonNameInput\nInitialize the state pokemonNameInput in the constructor to an empty string '' (you can try to set something else than an empty string and verify that this value is correctly displayed in your input)\nCreate a new handleInputChange method\nAdd a onChange handler to the  that will call this.handleInputChange\nAdd a parameter called event to the handleInputChange method and add a console.log with event.target.value. In your browser, try writting something in the . What do you see in the JavaScript console?\nUse setState in handleInputChange to record event.target.value in the state pokemonNameInput. In your browser, try writting something in the . What do you see this time in the JavaScript console?\nWe are now going to save the user input when clicking on the . Initialize caughtPokemon to an empty array [] instead of 0 in the constructor. In the render, use .length to display the number of items in the state array caughtPokemon (hint: it should still display 0 on the screen). Finally, delete the content of catchPokemon method (it should be empty, we will rewrite it later).\nIn catchPokemon method, create a variable newCaughtPokemon set to the state caughtPokemon and add the value of the state pokemonNameInput to it (hint: use push() to add a new item in an array).\nIn catchPokemon method, use setState to record the variable newCaughtPokemon in the state caughtPokemon. Open your browser, enter a pokemon name in the  and click on the button. Can you see the number of caught pokemon incrementing as you click on the button?\nWe are now going to display the names of the caught pokemon. In the render method, add a  element and use the .map() method on the caughtPokemon state to loop over each pokemon and return a  element for each.\nEmpty the  after clicking on the button. For this, in catchPokemon method, set the state of pokemonNameInput to an empty string ''.\n14: (STRETCH GOAL) Make sure the user cannot add a pokemon to the caughtPokemon state if the value of pokemonNameInput state is empty.\n\n\nFurther Reading\nThere is a new update to React, which adds a new feature called Hooks.

However, what if you wanted to have different pages with each page having its own URL (so you can bookmark it for example)? You will need to introduce a router in your application. In JavaScript, a router is the piece of code which is in charge of switching between views of your application and keep each view in sync with a specific URL. For example, you could imagine having a homepage reachable from the root path / and a users page with the path /users. In React, a popular library to help you achieve this is React-Router.\nLet's look at a first example (interactive example):\nconst Index = () => {\n  return Home;\n};\n\nconst About = () => {\n  return About;\n};\n\nconst Users = ({ names }) => {\n  return (\n    \n      Users\n      \n        {names.map(name => {name})}\n      \n    \n  );\n};\n\nconst AppRouter = () => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              Home\n            \n            \n              About\n            \n            \n              Users\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n        \n         } />\n      \n    \n  );\n};\n\nReact-Router provides some default React components that you can use to enable routing in your application. First, notice the top level  component which wraps everything else. Each route is defined with the  component which maps a path (defined with the path props) with a React component. In the simplest case, you can specify the React component to map to the path with the component props. However, it is assuming you don't need to pass any props to it. If you face a more complex scenarios or if you need to pass props to your React component, you can use the render props which takes a function and return exactly what you want to render on this path. Then, the Link component can be used to create links to navigate to different routes.\n\nExercise A\nOpen the pokedex React application. In this exercise, React-Router will be introduced. Instead of displaying all your components in the same page, we will use React-Router to define  different pages in the pokedex application.\n\nIn the terminal, install React-Router with npm install --save react-router-dom.\nOpen src/App.js and import BrowserRouter, Route and Link components from React-Router (hint: import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from \"react-router-dom\";)\nWrap all the components in the render method in the  component.\nIn the following, we will have CaughtPokemon and BestPokemon displayed with different route. But first, let's create some links to navigate to different pages. Still in the render method of src/App.js, use the Link component to create 2 links: one to navigate to the URL /best-pokemon and another one to navigate to /caught-pokemon (hint: Best Pokemon).\nOpen the pokedex in your browser and verify that you can see 2 links on the page. When clicking on each of these links, the URL in your browser address bar should change (but nothing will change on the screen yet!).\nNow let's define the routes to map a path to a React component. First, create a route to map /best-pokemon to the BestPokemon component. Then, use another route to map /caught-pokemon to the CaughtPokemon component (Hint: depending on if you pass some props to BestPokemon or CaughtPokemon you will need to use either the component or the render props in the  component).\nOpen the pokedex in your browser and verify that when clicking on each link, BestPokemon and CaughtPokemon are rendered accordingly.\n\n\nURL parameters\nSometimes, parameters can be passed from the URL to a React component directly via its props. In this case, different URLs can be mapped to one single React component. For example, in an online shopping application, a React component Product may be responsible to display a specific product on the page. By using URL parameters, the name or ID of the requested product can be specific in the URL and React-Router will pass it a props of the Product component (interactive example):\nconst Product = ({ match }) => {\n  return Product: {match.params.name};\n}\n\nconst AppRouter = () => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n        \n          Product List\n          \n            \n              Laptop\n            \n            \n              TV\n            \n            \n              Teddy Bear\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nIn the route definition above, a specific syntax is used to define the URL parameter: :name. Then in the Product component, the value of name can be accessed through the component props match.params.name.\n\nExercise B\nIn the following, we will create a new component to display a Pokemon information. The Pokemon name will be passed through the URL and displayed on the screen.\n\nCreate a new component PokemonInfo.\nIn src/App.js, create a new route which maps the path /pokemon/:name to the previously created component PokemonInfo (hint: ).\nIn the render method of PokemonInfo component, display the name of the Pokemon which is passed in the URL parameter (hint: use the props match.params.name).\nOpen the pokedex in your browser and try several URLs (such as http://localhost:3000/pokemon/Pikachu and see if the Pokemon name is displayed accordingly on your screen.\n(STRETCH GOAL) Instead of passing the name of the Pokemon in the URL parameter, now pass an ID. The ID passed correspond to the ID of the Pokemon in the Poke API. For example, the ID 1 corresponds to the Pokemon Bulbasaur (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/1/). In the PokemonInfo component, use the Pokemon ID from the URL to load the corresponding Pokemon data from the Poke API and display the following Pokemon information on the screen: name, color.name, shape.name, base_happiness and capture_rate.\n\n\nFurther Reading\nA lot of examples are available on the official React-Router website.\n"},"node/":{"url":"node/","title":"Node/DB","keywords":"","body":"Node\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\nWorkshop\n\n\n\n\nweek-13\nNode, Express workshop\nExpress Workshop 1\n\n\nweek-14\nMore Express\nExpress Workshop 2\n\n\nweek-15\nNode Best Practices\nHotel workshop\n\n\n\n"},"node/week-13/lesson.html":{"url":"node/week-13/lesson.html","title":"Week 16 - Node and Express 101","keywords":"","body":"\nNode 1\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nWhat is a server?\nNode and its ecosystem\nHTTP\nExpress\nAPIs\nWorkshop\n\n\nWhat is a server?\nServers are computer programs that receive requests from other programs, the\nclients and send back a response e.g share data, information or hardware and\nsoftware resources.\n...and what is a server in plain English?\nA server is a computer program.

It provides ways to store, retrieve and organize information.\nWhy do we need them?\nIn the past few weeks, you stored and retrieved data using files. This is fine for simple data but it can quickly become an issue as your application becomes more complex and needs to store and manipulate more complicated data. For example, imagine you want to develop the next biggest hotel booking application. You will need to store the list of hotels available for booking somewhere, and as you add more features, you will need to save users information, the reviews they post for each hotel, but also the bookings each user makes. You can see that the data you need to handle can become very complicated, especially when you need to consider that data are not static, as they can be updated or deleted. To work more effectively with data, we can then use a database, which present the following benefits:\n\nA database defines a structure for your data and the relationships between entities\nA database provides convenient and performant ways to safely store and retrieve data\nA database provides a mechanism to check the validity of your data\n\nDifferent types of database\nThere are many different kinds of database and different implementations. Sometimes, a database type is a better fit to certain use case or certain problems. The most well-known database types include relational database, key/value database, graph database and document database (also known as NoSQL). For this class, we will focus specifically on relational database as they are the most widely used and supported. You can consult DB-Engines to see a ranking of the most used database, as you can see, there is a lot of them!\nIntroduction to PostgreSQL\n\"PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

Data is stored in tables of rows and columns as per the example below:\n\n\n  \n\n\nHow about storing everything in one big table as shown below? Why isn't it a good idea?\nA customer could have several bookings. If the customer changes their telephone number, you would have to update every single rows for this customer with their new number, which is more prone to errors. As a general rule, try to avoid duplication of data, and instead design your system in a way that you have a single source of truth for each piece of data. The example below is NOT a good solution.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nDatabase modeling exercise\nScenario: You've been hired to create a database for a new company which wants to revolutionize the hotel booking market. The first task you've been given is to model how the company would store its data in a database. Here are your requirements:\n\nThe company wants to store in the database all the hotels available on their website\nFor each hotel, the company wants to record the name and the number of rooms. Also each hotel can have several room types and each room type has a specific price.\nThe company also needs to store the information of customers who registered on their website with a name, an email and an address.\nCustomers need to be able to record their bank details which consist of an account number and a sort code. Each customer can register several bank accounts if they want.\nFinally, as customers can book a room in an hotel starting on a specific date for a specific number of nights, the company wants to store the bookings.\n\nWith mentors help, model the database for this company. In particular, show the different entities, fields and relationships between each entity.\nCheck your PostgreSQL installation\nOpen a terminal in your laptop and verify the command psql -V returns the version of PostgreSQL. In psql, you can type use the command help to show the help menu. Within the command prompt, you can enter SQL statements and run them against PostgreSQL. To quit psql, enter the command \\q.\nCommunicating with the database using SQL\nAll commands in the following need to be entered in a psql command prompt. However, sometimes it's easier to write the code in a file and then load the file with psql. For example, if you write your SQL code in a file called test.sql, you can then execute it with psql -d DATABASE_NAME -f test.sql.\nCreating a new database\nIn a terminal, create a new database named cyf_hotels with the following command:\ncreatedb cyf_hotels\nThen connect to your database with:\npsql cyf_hotels\n\nCreating a table\nData are stored in tables. Let's first create a customers table to hold the details of customers.\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n    id        SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name      VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,\n    email     VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,\n    address   VARCHAR(120),\n    city      VARCHAR(30),\n    postcode  VARCHAR(12),\n    country   VARCHAR(20)\n);\n\nFew things to mention from the SQL statement above:\n\nSERIAL PRIMARY KEY defines the column id as a unique identifier for each row. Moreover, this identifier will automatically incremented every time data is inserted. id is called the primary key of the table customers.\nVARCHAR(20) defines the column to hold text data with a maximum length of 20 characters\nNOT NULL defines the column as not nullable, which means that you must set a value.\nOther useful types include INT, TEXT, BOOLEAN and DATE.\nThe database will reject any values which don't match the type.\n\nExercise 1\n\nCreate the customers table in the cyf_hotels database.\nVerify that the table customers is created with the psql command \\dt which lists the existing tables.\nDisplay the table customers definition with the command \\d customers and verify that it matches what you expect.\nCreate a new table hotels in the cyf_hotels database with the following columns: an id, a name, the number of rooms and the hotel postcode. Use the commands above to verify that the table is correctly created.\n\nNow that we have a table to store customers and a table to store hotels, we can create a table to hold the bookings of customers for an hotel with the checkin date and the number of nights they intend to stay:\nCREATE TABLE bookings (\n    id               SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    customer_id      INT REFERENCES customers(id),\n    hotel_id         INT REFERENCES hotels(id),\n    checkin_date     DATE NOT NULL,\n    nights           INT NOT NULL\n);\n\nIn the above, customer_id and hotel_id are called foreign keys as they reference an id from a different table. This set a very strong constraint as you will not be able to create a booking for a customer id which does not exist in the customers table!\nExercise 2\n\nCreate the table bookings in your cyf_hotels database and verify that it is correctly created.\n\nInserting data\nOnce your customers, hotels and bookings table are created, you can insert data with the following SQL statements:\nINSERT INTO customers (name, email, address, city, postcode, country) VALUES ('John Smith','j.smith@johnsmith.org','11 New Road','Liverpool','L10 2AB','UK');\nINSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ('Triple Point Hotel', 10, 'CM194JS');\nINSERT INTO bookings (customer_id, hotel_id, checkin_date, nights) VALUES (1, 1, '2019-10-01', 2);\n\nThe data you insert should be of the same type with your table definition. For example, the following insert statement will fail:\nINSERT INTO bookings (customer_id, hotel_id, checkin_date, nights) VALUES (1, 1, '2019-14-01', 2);\n\nExercise 3\n\nRun the 3 SQL statements above.\nInsert yourself in the customers table.\nInsert the following 3 hotels in the hotels table:\nThe Triple Point Hotel has 10 rooms, its postcode is CM194JS\nThe Royal Cosmos Hotel has 5 rooms, its postcode is TR209AX\nThe Pacific Petal Motel has 15 rooms, its postcode is BN180TG\n\n\nTry to insert a booking for a customer id which does not exist in the customers table (for example ID 100). What is happening and why?\n\nRetrieving data\nPreviously, you have inserted data in your tables. How do you make sure these data have been inserted correctly? The following SQL statement is used to request data from a specific table:\nSELECT * FROM customers;\n\nExercise 4\n\nUse the above SQL statement to display all the data inserted in the customers table.\nUse the above SQL statement to display all the data inserted in the hotels table.\nUse the above SQL statement to display all the data inserted in the bookings table.\n\nRetrieving data with conditions\nActually, the SELECT statement is very powerful and you will see you can request a lot of different things with it. Have you seen the * character in the SQL statement above? It means that you want to see the data for all the columns of the table. What if you want to only return specific columns? For example, to retrieve all customers name and address from the table customers:\nSELECT name,address FROM customers;\n\nSometimes, you want to retrieve only data which verify a specific condition. In this case, you can use a WHERE clause. For example, to retrieve all hotels having more than 7 rooms:\nSELECT * FROM hotels WHERE rooms > 7;\n\nTo retrieve the customer name and address with id 1:\nSELECT name,address FROM customers WHERE id = 1;\n\nTo retrieve all the bookings starting after 2019/10/01:\nSELECT * FROM bookings WHERE checkin_date > '2019/10/01';\n\nTo retrieve all the bookings starting after 2019/10/01 for a minimum of 2 nights:\nSELECT * FROM bookings WHERE checkin_date > '2019/10/01' AND nights >= 2;\n\nTo retrieve all the hotels with the postcode CM194JS or TR209AX:\nSELECT * FROM hotels WHERE postcode = 'CM194JS' OR postcode = 'TR209AX';\n\nExercise 5\n\nExecute the file cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql which will reset your existing tables and insert more data in the customers, hotels and bookings tables. (hint: in the terminal, use psql -d cyf_hotels -f cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql).\nRetrieve all information for the customer Laurence Lebihan.\nRetrieve all customers name living in UK.\nRetrieve the address, city and postcode of Melinda Marsh.\nRetrieve all hotels located in the postcode DGQ127.\nRetrieve all hotels with more than 11 rooms.\nRetrieve all hotels with more than 6 rooms but less than 15 rooms.\nRetrieve all hotels with exactly 10 rooms or 20 rooms.\nRetrieve all bookings for customer id 1.\nRetrieve all bookings for more than 4 nights.\nRetrieve all bookings starting in 2020.\nRetrieve all bookings before 2020 for less than 4 nights.\n\nHomework\n\nCreate a new database called cyf_classes (hint: use createdb in the terminal)\nCreate a new table mentors, for each mentor we want to save their name, how many years they lived in Glasgow, their address and their favourite programming language.\nInsert 5 mentors in the mentors table (you can make up the data, it doesn't need to be accurate ;-)).\nCreate a new table students, for each student we want to save their name, address and if they have graduated from Code Your Future.\nInsert 10 students in the students table.\nVerify that the data you created for mentors and students are correctly stored in their respective tables (hint: use a select SQL statement).\nCreate a new classes table to record the following information:\nA class has a leading mentor\nA class has a topic (such as Javascript, NodeJS)\nA class is taught at a specific date and at a specific location\n\n\nInsert a few classes in the classes table\nWe now want to store who among the students attends a specific class. How would you store that? Come up with a solution and insert some data if you model this as a new table.\nAnswer the following questions using a select SQL statement:\nRetrieve all the mentors who lived more than 5 years in Glasgow\nRetrieve all the mentors whose favourite language is Javascript\nRetrieve all the students who are CYF graduates\nRetrieve all the classes taught before June this year\nRetrieve all the students (retrieving student ids only is fine) who attended the Javascript class (or any other class that you have in the classes table).\n\n\n\n"},"db/week-2/lesson.html":{"url":"db/week-2/lesson.html","title":"Week 19 - More SQL and integration with NodeJS","keywords":"","body":"Database 2: More SQL and integration with NodeJS\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nRevision from last week\nMore SQL\nChanging the definition of a table\nDropping a table\nUpdating a row\nDeleting a row\nJoin tables\nOther useful operations\n\n\nIntegration with NodeJS\nIntroduction to node-postgres\nLoading data from a database with a GET endpoint\n\n\nHomework\n\nMore SQL\nFor the following, use the file cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql from the previous class to reinitialise your database with psql -d cyf_hotels -f cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql.\nChanging the definition of a table\nSometimes, you may need to change the definition of a table you created before without deleting it. Such changes include renaming a table, adding/removing a column, changing the name of a column, changing the type of a column etc... The general syntax to perform these operations is:\nALTER TABLE table_name action;\n\nFor example, to add a new column to the existing customers table:\nALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN date_of_birth DATE;\n\nTo delete an existing column from the customers table:\nALTER TABLE customers DROP COLUMN date_of_birth;\n\nTo rename the table customers into clients:\nALTER TABLE customers RENAME TO clients;\n\nFor more examples, you can consult the following tutorial: Postgres alter table.\nExercise 1\n\nAdd a column date_of_birth of type DATE in the customers table.\nRename the column date_of_birth to birthdate in the customers table.\nDelete the column birthdate from the customers table.\n\nDropping a table\nTo delete the table customers:\nDROP TABLE customers;\n\nExercise 2:\n\nCreate a new table test\nDrop the table test\n\nUpdating a row\nThe general construction to update a row is:\nUPDATE table SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;\n\nFor example, to update the name and country of the customers with ID 3:\nUPDATE customers SET name='Bob Marley', country='Jamaica' WHERE id=3;\n\nExercise 3\n\nUpdate the postcode of the hotel named Elder Lake Hotel to L10XYZ\nUpdate the number of rooms of Cozy Hotel to 25\nFor the customer named Nadia Sethuraman, update her address to 2 Blue Street, her city to Glasgow and her postcode to G11ABC in one query\nUpdate all the bookings of customer with ID 1 for the hotel with ID 1 to 5 nights in one query\n\nDeleting a row\nThe syntax to delete a row is:\nDELETE FROM table WHERE condition;\n\nFor example, to delete the booking with ID 4:\nDELETE FROM bookings WHERE id=4;\n\nNOTE: If you don't supply a WHERE clause with DELETE or UPDATE the command will be applied to all the rows in the table which is rarely what you want.\nExercise 4\n\nDelete the booking of customer ID 8 for the date 2020-01-03\nDelete all the bookings of customer ID 6\nDelete the customer with ID 6\n\nJoining tables\nSometimes, you will need to retrieve data which are spread in different tables in a single response. For this purpose, you will need to join tables together. The general syntax is:\nSELECT A.column1, B.column2 FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.b_id=B.id;\n\nFor example, to load all the bookings along with customer data:\nSELECT * FROM customers INNER JOIN bookings ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id;\n\nTo load all the bookings along with customer data and hotel data:\nSELECT * FROM bookings\nINNER JOIN customers ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id\nINNER JOIN hotels ON hotels.id=bookings.hotel_id;\n\nTo load the booking checkin dates for customer ID 1 along with the customer name and the hotel name:\nSELECT bookings.checkin_date,customers.name,hotels.name FROM bookings\nINNER JOIN customers ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id\nINNER JOIN hotels ON hotels.id=bookings.hotel_id\nWHERE customers.id=1;\n\nExercise 5\n\nTry and understand each of the queries above in your psql prompt\nRetrieve all the bookings along with customer data for bookings starting in 2020\nRetrieve the customer names, booking start dates and number of nights for all customers who booked the hotel name Jade Peaks Hotel\nRetrieve all the booking start dates with customer names and hotel names for all bookings for more than 5 nights\n\nOther useful operations\nOrdering the result:\nSELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column;\n\nThis will sort the returned rows in the ascending order for \"column\". To sort them in descending order, use:\nSELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column DESC;\n\nLimiting the number of results returned:\nSELECT * FROM table LIMIT 10;\n\nReturning all customers whose ID is 1, 2, 3 or 4:\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE id IN (1,2,3,4);\n\nQuery by pattern matching, for example retrieve all customers whose name starts with Bob:\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'Bob%';\n\nYou can combine different operations together, for example, if you want to retrieve all the booking start dates with the customer names and hotel names for customer names starting with the letter M ordered by hotel name with a limit of 3 results:\nSELECT bookings.checkin_date,customers.name,hotels.name FROM bookings\nINNER JOIN customers ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id\nINNER JOIN hotels ON hotels.id=bookings.hotel_id\nWHERE customers.name LIKE 'M%'\nORDER BY hotels.name\nLIMIT 3;\n\nExercise 6\n\nRetrieve all customers whose name starts with the letter S\nRetrieve all hotels which have the word Hotel in their name\nRetrieve the booking start date, customer name, hotel name for the top 5 bookings ordered by number of nights in descending order\n\nIntegration with NodeJS\nIntroduction to node-postgres\n\"node-postgres is a collection of node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database.\" - https://node-postgres.com/\nIn the following, we will use node-postgres to...\n\nConnect to a database\nSend SQL query to the database and get results\n\nLoading data from a database with a GET endpoint\nLet's build a brand new NodeJS application with a single GET endpoint to load the list of hotels that you already have in the hotels table of the cyf_hotels database.\nFirst, create a new NodeJS application that we will call cyf-hotels-api (enter server.js when asking about the entry point):\nmkdir cyf-hotels-api && cd cyf-hotels-api && npm init\nAs before, we will use the Express library to build our API, and the node-postgres library to connect with our database:\nnpm install --save express\nnpm install --save pg\nCreate a server.js file, import express, initialise the server and start listening for requests:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n    console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000.

You can write any valid SQL query that you learned in the query() method!\n\nStart your server with node server.js and try to reach the /hotels endpoint to see the list of hotels currently available in your hotels table of your cyf_hotels database. You can try to create/update/delete hotels to verify that your API always returns what is stored in your database.\nHomework\nIn this homework, you are going to work with an ecommerce database. In this database, you have products that consumers can buy from different suppliers. Customers can create an order and several products can be added in one order.\nTo prepare your environment for this homework, open a terminal and create a new database called cyf_ecommerce:\ncreatedb cyf_ecommerce\nImport the file cyf_ecommerce.sql in your newly created database:\npsql -d cyf_ecommerce -f cyf_ecommerce.sql\n\nOpen the file cyf_ecommerce.sql in VSCode and make sure you understand all the SQL code.

To start from a clean state for your cyf_hotels database, run psql -d cyf_hotels -f cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql.\nDuring the last class, we created a new NodeJS project called cyf-hotels-api with a single API endpoint /hotels to get the list of all hotels. In this class, we will add other endpoints with more functionalities to interact with the cyf_hotels database.\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst { Pool } = require('pg');\n\nconst pool = new Pool({\n    user: 'postgres',\n    host: 'localhost',\n    database: 'cyf_hotels',\n    password: '',\n    port: 5432\n});\n\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function(req, res) {\n    pool.query('SELECT * FROM hotels')\n        .then(result => res.json(result.rows))\n        .catch(e => console.error(e));\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n    console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000.

Each letter in the acronym can map to a standard Structured Query Language (SQL) statement and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method [...].\" - Wikipedia\n\n\n  \n\n\nCreating data\nIn the following, we will add a new API endpoint to create a new hotel in the table hotels of the cyf_hotels database. As a reminder, here is an example of a SQL insert statement to add a new hotel:\nINSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ('New Hotel', 5, 'ABC001');\n\nAs we create a new record in the database, we will add a new POST endpoint in the cyf-hotels-api project from last class. Moreover, we need to be able to pass some parameters to this API endpoint such as the hotel name, the number of rooms and the postcode, so we can use this API to create different hotel. These parameters can be sent in the body of the request. To access the parameters in the body of the request with Express.JS, we need to add the module body-parser to the cyf-hotels-api project:\nnpm install --save body-parser\nThen include it in the server.js:\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\nWe can finally add our new endpoint to create a new hotel:\napp.post(\"/hotels\", function(req, res) {\n    const newHotelName = req.body.name;\n    const newHotelRooms = req.body.rooms;\n    const newHotelPostcode = req.body.postcode;\n\n    const query = \"INSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)\";\n\n    pool.query(query, [newHotelName, newHotelRooms, newHotelPostcode])\n        .then(() => res.send(\"Hotel created!\"))\n        .catch(e => console.error(e));\n});\n\nWhat could go wrong with the code above? There is no validation of any user inputs which could result in errors, duplications or inconsistent data in the database! Here are few examples of things we can verify before creating the hotel in the database:\n\nCheck that the number of rooms is a positive number\nCheck that no hotel with the same name already exists in the database\n...\n\nLet's start by validating that the number of rooms is a positive number and if it doesn't, return an error.\nif(!Number.isInteger(newHotelRooms) || newHotelRooms \nThen we can validate the new hotel doesn't already exist in the database, thus preventing duplicate data.\napp.post(\"/hotels\", function(req, res) {\n    const newHotelName = req.body.name;\n    const newHotelRooms = req.body.rooms;\n    const newHotelPostcode = req.body.postcode;\n\n    if(!Number.isInteger(newHotelRooms) || newHotelRooms  {\n            if(result.rows.length > 0) {\n                return res.status(400).send('An hotel with the same name already exists!');\n            } else {\n                const query = \"INSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)\";\n                pool.query(query, [newHotelName, newHotelRooms, newHotelPostcode])\n                    .then(() => res.send(\"Hotel created!\"))\n                    .catch(e => console.error(e));\n            }\n        });\n});\n\nExercise 1\n\nFollow the above steps to create a new POST endpoint /hotels to create a new hotel. Make sure to add validation for the number of rooms and the hotel name. Test your new API endpoint with Postman and check that the new hotel has been correctly created in your database.\nAdd a new POST API endpoint to create a new customer in the customers table.\nAdd validation to check that there is no other customer with the same name in the customers table before creating a new customer.\n\nReading data\nWe already have one GET endpoint to load all the hotels in the database. However, we can improve this endpoint and add a couple of extra functionalities. First, we may want to order the list of hotels by name:\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function(req, res) {\n    pool.query(\"SELECT * FROM hotels ORDER BY name\")\n        .then(result => res.json(result.rows))\n        .catch(e => console.error(e));\n});\n\nAnother functionality which could be useful is to filter the hotel with a keyword to be able to search for a specific hotel name:\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function(req, res) {\n    const hotelNameQuery = req.query.name;\n    let query = `SELECT * FROM hotels ORDER BY name`;\n\n    if(hotelNameQuery) {\n        query = `SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE name LIKE '%${hotelNameQuery}%' ORDER BY name`;\n    }\n\n    pool.query(query)\n        .then(result => res.json(result.rows))\n        .catch(e => console.error(e));\n});\n\nIn some case, you would want to load only a specific hotel by id. Let's define a new GET endpoint to load one specific hotel:\napp.get(\"/hotels/:hotelId\", function(req, res) {\n    const hotelId = req.params.hotelId;\n\n    pool.query(\"SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE id=$1\", [hotelId])\n        .then(result => res.json(result.rows))\n        .catch(e => console.error(e));\n});\n\nExercise 2\n\nAdd the GET endpoints /hotels and /hotels/:hotelId mentioned above and try to use these endpoints with Postman.\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers to load all customers ordered by name.\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers/:customerId to load one customer by ID.\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers/:customerId/bookings to load all the bookings of a specific customer. Returns the following information: check in date, number of nights, hotel name, hotel postcode.\n\nUpdating data\nWe can now implement an endpoint to update a customer record in the database. For this, we will use a PUT endpoint.\napp.put(\"/customers/:customerId\", function(req, res) {\n    const customerId = req.params.customerId;\n    const newEmail = req.body.email;\n\n    pool.query(\"UPDATE customers SET email=$1 WHERE id=$2\", [newEmail, customerId])\n        .then(() => res.send(`Customer ${customerId} updated!`))\n        .catch(e => console.error(e));\n});\n\nWhat can go wrong in the code above? Again, there is no validation! We could set an empty email or even a string which is not following the format of an email. Remember, validating data is very important to make sure you don't end up with inconsistent data in your database!\nExercise 3\n\nAdd the PUT endpoint /customers/:customerId and verify you can update a customer email using Postman.\nAdd validation for the email before updating the customer record in the database. If the email is empty, return an error message.\nAdd the possibility to also update the address, the city, the postcode and the country of a customer. Be aware that if you want to update the city only for example, the other fields should not be changed!\n\nDeleting data\nTo delete a record from the database, we will use a DELETE endpoint:\napp.delete(\"/customers/:customerId\", function(req, res) {\n    const customerId = req.params.customerId;\n\n    pool.query(\"DELETE FROM customers WHERE id=$1\", [customerId])\n        .then(() => res.send(`Customer ${customerId} deleted!`))\n        .catch(e => console.error(e));\n});\n\nHowever, if you try to delete a customer which already has some bookings, the previous endpoint will fail. Do you know why? You cannot delete a customer whose ID is used as a foreign key in another table (in this case, in the bookings table). Let's delete all the customer bookings first:\napp.delete(\"/customers/:customerId\", function(req, res) {\n    const customerId = req.params.customerId;\n\n    pool.query(\"DELETE FROM bookings WHERE customer_id=$1\", [customerId])\n        .then(() => {\n            pool.query(\"DELETE FROM customers WHERE id=$1\", [customerId])\n                .then(() => res.send(`Customer ${customerId} deleted!`))\n                .catch(e => console.error(e));;\n        })\n        .catch(e => console.error(e));\n});\n\nExercise 4\n\nAdd the DELETE endpoint /customers/:customerId above and verify you can delete a customer along their bookings with Postman.\nAdd a new DELETE endpoint /hotels/:hotelId to delete a specific hotel. A hotel can only be deleted if it doesn't appear in any of the customers' bookings!

This endpoint should still work even if you don't use the name query parameter!\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers/:customerId to load a single customer by ID.\nAdd a new POST endpoint /customers to create a new customer. \nAdda new POST endpoint /products to create a new product (with a product name, a price and a supplier id). Check that the price is a positive integer and that the supplier ID exists in the database, otherwise return an error.\nAdd a new POST endpoint /customers/:customerId/orders to create a new order (including an order date, and an order reference) for a customer. Check that the customerId corresponds to an existing customer or return an error.\nAdd a new PUT endpoint /customers/:customerId to update an existing customer (name, address, city and country).\nAdd a new DELETE endpoint /orders/:orderId to delete an existing order along all the associated order items.\nAdd a new DELETE endpoint /customers/:customerId to delete an existing customer only if this customer doesn't have orders.\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers/:customerId/orders to load all the orders along the  items in the orders of a specific customer. Especially, the following information should be returned: order references, order dates, product names, unit prices, suppliers and quantities.\n\n"},"others/useful-links.html":{"url":"others/useful-links.html","title":"Useful links","keywords":"","body":"Useful Links and Resources\nContents\n\nCode Your Future\nGetting Started\nGIT\nHTML and CSS\nJavaScript Core\nNode.js and APIs\nDatabases and MongoDB\nReact\nJavaScript Advanced\nFurther Reading\nMeetups\nGetting a Job\n\n\nCode Your Future:\n\nCYF General: \nCYF Website / \nCYF Twitter / \nCYF Facebook\nClass Locations (Google Maps): \nKinning Park Complex / \nCollabor8\nThe CYF Scotland Syllabus on GitHub\n\nGetting Started\n\nHTML, CSS, JavaScript Explained - a fast 4 minute summary (video)\nBasic Linux Commands for Beginners / \nNavigating the Terminal (Mac)\nVisual Studio Code: \nDownload / \nTutorials\n\nGIT\n\nLearn Version Control with Git\ntryGit - Interactive Git tutorial\nLearn Git Branching\nGit & GitHub: Introduction to Git & GitHub (video)\nGitHub Guides\nFlight rules for Git\nHow to create a website on Github Pages (video)\n\nHTML and CSS\n\nMarkSheet - free HTML and CSS tutorial\nLearn to Code HTML & CSS: \nBeginner / \nAdvanced\nMozilla Developer Guide: \nHTML Basics / \nHTML elements reference / \nHTML attribute reference\nResponsive Web Design Fundamentals\nCSS Reference - A free visual guide to CSS\nCSS Games: \nCSS Diner / \nFlexbox Froggy / \nSuper Markup World\nCSS Flexbox: \nSolved by Flexbox / \nFlexbox Patterns / \nHow Flexbox works / \nWhat the Flexbox?\nLearn CSS Grid for free\nLearn Bootstrap 4 for free\n\nJavaScript Core\n\nGetting Started with JavaScript for Web Development\njavascript.info - The Modern JavaScript Tutorial\nJavaScript For Cats\nJavaScript String Reference / JavaScript Array Reference\nStar Wars: Building a Galaxy With Code\nJavaScript - Exercises, Practice, Solution\nJavaScript30 - 30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge\nSuperheroJS\n\nNode.js and APIs\n\nNode School - Open source workshops that teach web software skills\nNode.js Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Node in 1 Hour (video)\nJSON Crash Course (video)\nBuild a RESTful Node.js API (video)\n\nDatabases and MongoDB\n\nMongoDB In 30 Minutes (video)\nMongoDB Tutorial for Beginners (video)\n\nReact\n\nLearning React by Building Games: The Memory Grid\nA React Christmas\n\nJavaScript Advanced\n\nWhat the heck is the event loop anyway?

By default GitHub repos prevent most people from pushing to them. This is ensure that repo owners have control over the project.\nThis doesn't mean you will never be able to make changes to the repo! On GitHub you do this by creating a \"fork\". A fork is an exact copy of the original repo but copied to your own GitHub account. This means that now you can push to it!\nThis is why you will need to create a fork when submitting a PR for your homework.\nWhat is a remote?\nGit has a concept of a \"remote\". These are other git repositories that can be connected to over the internet. You can push or pull code changes from them. Remotes have a name and a URL. Most of the remotes that you will use at CYF are hosted on GitHub, so have a github.com URL.\nWhen you clone a repo from GitHub, the default remote is named origin and the URL is set to that of the GitHub repo.\nYou can view the remotes you have set up with:\ngit remote -v\nHow to fork a GitHub repo\nFirstly you need to click the \"Fork\" button:\n\nThen you should be brought to your new fork (notice how the repo title changes):\n\nNow you can clone from your fork by copying the URL here:\n\nThe command to clone is:\ngit clone URL_YOU_JUST_COPIED\nAdding a Remote\nFollow these instructions if you are getting an permission error when pushing your changes. If you have cloned the original repo before forking, you'll need to follow these instructions. You can check this by running git remote -v. If the output looks something like:\norigin git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/css-skin.git (fetch)\norigin git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/css-skin.git (push)\nthen you have cloned before forking. The key is that the origin remote is pointing to a CodeYourFuture URL. Don't worry, we can fix it!\nThe first step is to fork the original repo. Follow the first 2 steps from forking instructions above.\nNow, instead of cloning the fork (you have already cloned), you need to add it as a remote.\nRun:\ngit remote add fork URL_YOU_COPIED_FROM_FORK\nThis will add a new remote called fork that points to your new fork. To check this, run git remote -v again. You should see both the origin and fork remotes.\nNow that you have your fork remote you can push to it (instead of the origin remote, which will error) by running:\ngit push fork\nYou'll need to remember to add the fork every time you push.\nCreating a PR\nSo you've done your homework, you've committed your changes and are ready to make a PR. Congrats! &#x1F389;&#x1F389;&#x1F389;\nAt this point you should have followed the instructions either to fork the original repo or added a remote to your fork. If you haven't make sure you read those sections first.\nYou will need to push to your fork. If you forked and then cloned (as in the how to fork instructions) then you just need to run git push. If you added a remote to your fork, then you will need to run git push fork.\nNext you need to go the original repo in your browser (probably starting with https://github.com/CodeYourFuture). Next click the Pull Requests tab:\n\nThen click the New pull request button:\n\nThen click the \"compare across forks\" link:\n\nThen click the \"head fork\" dropdown button:\n\nThen find your fork in the list and click it:\n\nThen click the Create pull request button:\n\nAlmost there! Now fill out the PR form. Give it a sensible title and an (optional) description:\n\nAnd finally click the Create pull request button at the bottom of the form:\n\nThat's it!

Tie into the idea of how in a\nprogram these would be the ‘tools’ required for an activity and how for our\nsandwich making task the items we have listed previously are our classes\n\n\nNow that we have all of the tools we need to make a sandwich ask the students\nto shout out what they think the first step or instruction is:\nWrite the instruction out on the screen and ask the students which object\nwould be needed to carry out that instruction\nCopy the instruction and place it under the object that the students have\ndecided is responsible for it and introduce the idea of methods\nContinue asking the students for instructions and listing them under the\nobjects that would be responsible for them (in the case where two objects\nare required to carry out an instruction try and break it down further with\nthe students until only one object is responsible for any one instruction –\ncould be a good way to introduce the idea of how specific you need to be in\nprogramming and the concepts that are detailed in the source example of\nthis exercise)\n\n\nOnce the students are satisfied with the instructions take the best formed\nclass and ask the students to come up with a one word summary for each\ninstruction that is has. Explain the benefits of well named methods in\nprogramming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.\n\nGetting started with JavaScript\nWe will spend most of this lesson in Codepen. To get started, go to\ncodepen.io/pen/ to create a new Pen. On the bottom left,\nclick the \"Console\" button to open the console.\n\nYou can place your cursor right behind the > sign. Type a simple expression,\nsuch as 2 + 2 and hit enter. You will see expression, as well as its result,\nin the window above.\n\nYou will be able to follow most of this session along just entering expressions\nin the console like this.\nVariables and assignments\nFor an expression or a value to be of any use to us, we need to store it in a\nvariable.\nVariables have a name (identifier) that we can use to refer to a value. You\ncan assign a value to a variable with the following statement:\nvar x = 3;\n^   ^ ^ ^\n|   | | value\n|   | assignment operator\n|   identifier\ndeclaration statement\nLet’s break this statement down:\n\nvar: With the var statement we tell the JavaScript engine that x is now\na variable\nx: The variable name/identifier. It can be short or long, but must not\ncontain spaces and must not start with a number.\n=: The equal sign is the assigmnent operator\n3: The value that we assign to the variable. This can be any number, string\nor boolean, or any more complex data type that we will introduce later. You\ncan also use an existing variable here.\n;: THe semicolon is not strictly needed, but is generally used to terminate\na statement.\n\nNow you can use the identifier instead of the actual value in an expression:\nx + x, x * x, console.log(x)\nSimple data types & Expressions\nNumbers\nLet’s start with something seemingly simple - numbers. Here are some:\n1;\n15;\n3195803798;\n1.4;\n0.0000005;\n0 - 23;\n\nYou will see that there are whole numbers (no decimal point) and real numbers\n(decimal point), which in JavaScript are so-called “floating point” numbers.\nNumbers can be positive or negative and they support all the basic math\noperators that you would expect:\n2 + 2; // 4\n2 - 5; // -3\n2 * 3; // 6\n10 / 2; // 5\n3 * -2; // -6\n\nOperators have the same precedence as in algebra: * and / have higher\nprecedence than + and -.\n\nTODO: Do math exercise\nTODO: What about Infinity, Math.PI, IEEE floating point bullshit, NaN\n\nStrings\nStrings represent any sort of text. They are delimited by single quotes (') or\ndouble quotes (”) and can be of any length.\n'' // empty string\n\"\" // empty string\n'Hello'\n'I am learning JavaScript'\n'It\\'s been a great journey so far!'\n\"Double quotes work as well\"\n\nIf you need single or double quotes inside the string, you need to “escape”\nthem by putting a backslash in front of them. If you don’t do this, the\nJavaScript engine will think the string ends here, because it encounters a\nquote.\n\nThe most common operation on strings is to append one string to another. This is\ncalled string concatenation. It’s achieved by the plus (+) operator:\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" // \"HelloWorld\"\n\nTODO: Introduce string concatenation\nTODO: What about basic string functions, like substr, replace etc?\n\nBooleans\nBooleans are a data type that\ncan only have two values: true and false.\nLike numbers, they can be combined using operators, but there are different\noperators for booleans (analoguous to\nBoolean algebra). The most\nimportant ones are:\n\n! (NOT), which negates a value:\n\n!true; // false\n!false; // true\n\n\n&& (AND), which is only true if both operands are true:\n\nfalse && false; // false\ntrue && false; // false\nfalse && true; // false\ntrue && true; // true\n\n\n|| (OR), which is true if at least one of the operands is true:\n\nfalse && false; // false\ntrue && false; // true\nfalse && true; // true\ntrue && true; // true\n\nTODO: When to introduce truthiness and falsiness? Probably in comparisons?\n\n\nExercise: Put simple mathematical expressions into the console: 2 * 2,\n2 + 2, 5 * 7 - 13 > Exercise: Calculate the area of a circle (r * r *\npi). Do a quick Google search on how to use PI in JavaScript.\nSee what happens when you \"add\" two strings together\nResearch the JS Math library. sqrt, floor, ceil, round\nWrite an expression that outputs the percentage of students who are female.\nMake it so it outputs it as 58%, and make sure you use the actual numbers of\nwomen and the total number of students. Solution: console.log(Math.round(7 /\n17 * 100) + \"%\");\n\nFrom REPL to console.log\n\nSingle expressions are not very useful, you want to write applications\nMore than one statement? Move it to the JS box in Codepen\nNow you don't get any immediate feedback\nUse console.log to print to the console: console.log(3 + 3);\nWrite statements below each other\n\n\nTHOUGHT: Codepen does not have a \"run\" button, so it's quite intransparent\nwhen it actually re-runs a program. Maybe a different tool is better? A simple\njsbin configuration, maybe?\n\n"},"others/aws-workshop-2.html":{"url":"others/aws-workshop-2.html","title":"AWS - DynamoDB","keywords":"","body":"\nNode 4\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nDatabases overview\nMongoDB\nMongo Shell\nMongo with Node\n\n\nBefore we start\nDownload and install MongoDb from\nhttps://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community . Follow the instructions for\nyour platform (Windows, Linux or OS X).\nAlso download and install RoboMongo from https://robomongo.org/download.\nOpen two instances of terminal. Run mongod - this will start MongoDB then run\nmongo on the other window.\n\nIn the mongo shell (terminal) - run the command version() and you should get\nthe version of Mongo printed on the terminal\nDatabases overview\n\nDiscussion:\n\nWhat is a database role?\nWhy do we need a database? Why not just use the file system?\nWhat would make a good database?\n\n\nWhy a database?\n\nDatabases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up\nlittle space).\nYou can have strucutre on your data\nYou can query for data in a database, you can sort data, add/edit/delete data\nYou can optimise a database to make searches (queries) quicker\nYou can relate pieces of data to each other to avoid duplication which makes\nyour information more reliable and less prone to errors\nACID\nIn computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is\na set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity\neven in the event of errors, power failures, etc.\n\n\nDatabases can handle very large data sets.\nDatabases are concurrent; multiple users can use them at the same time without\ncorrupting the data.\nDatabases scale well\n\nRelational and non-relational databases\nThere are mainly two flavours of databases used commercially these days.\nRelational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.\nRelational databases include MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle\nDatabase and many others. They've been around for a long time and they're used\nfor all kind of applications.\nNon-relational databases are relatively new and they include the likes of\nMongoDB, Casandra, Neo4j etc...\nMongo\n\nMongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database\nprogram. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like\ndocuments.\n\nBSON (JSON-like document)\nIn a Relational database, information is organised in rows in tables with\npredefined columns.\nIn a non-relational database, information is organised in documents. MongoDB\nstores data records in a format similar to JSON called BSON. BSON is a binary\nrepresentation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.\n\nLet's look at this database table Students containing information about\nstudents participating in a course \n\nExercise: What are the columns, rows and tables?\n\n\n\nExercise: Open https://jsonlint.com/ and write a JSON representation of two\nrows in the Students table example. Click Validate JSON and make sure the\ndocument is valid.\n\nAre there any alternative representations you can think of?\n\n\nBSON is very similar to JSON. It contains more data types than JSON, it also\nallows the field names to not be quoted. Read more information about the\nformat - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/.\nMongo Shell\nLet's go to mongo shell and start interacting with our database system.\n1. create a database\nOn the shell, type the command use profile The shell should respond with\nswitched to db profile. At this stage, the database does not necessarily\nexist once we start adding information (collections) then the database will be\ncreated and the collection added to them.\nTo check the current database, run db.\n2. create a collection\nNow let's create our first collection. Make sure you're using the profile\ndatabase. Run db and it should print profile on the terminal.\nWe will insert a simple document representing a student.\n\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Habiiba', country: 'Somalia', assignedMentors:\n['Ashleigh'] })\n\nYou should get a confirmation with the number of records inserted.\nYou can also insert more than one document at a time. Run this command\n\ndb.students.insertMany([{ name: 'Khalid', country: 'Yemen' }, { name:\n'Yohannes', country: 'Ethiopia', assignedMentors: ['Michael'] }])\n\nrun the command db.students.count() and you should get that you have 3\ndocuments.\n3. Querying data\nQuerying is one of the most important reasons that we use databases. SQL is the\nlanguage used for querying relational databases, In MongoDB, we can use the\nmethod db.collection.find, passing a query in the form of a JSON object as a\nfirst parameter.\nLet's try few queries:\nGet all the students from Ethiopia.\n\ndb.students.find({country: 'Ethiopia'})\n\nWe can also provide an extra parameter projection to define what fields we\nwant back from the query.\nFor example, if we're only interested in the name\ndb.students.find({ country: \"Ethiopia\" }, { name: 1 });\n// you can also use { name: true }\n\nLet's add another two students to the collection\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Sudan', assignedMentors:\n['Michael'] })\nand\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Syria', assignedMentors:\n['Michael', 'Ashleigh'] })\nNow let's query for all the students that have Michael as mentor.\ndb.students.find({ assignedMentors: [\"Michael\"] });\n\nWhat if we want to find any student whose name is \"Mohamed\" AND whose country is\n\"Sudan\". You can then use the logical query operator $and.\ndb.students.find({\n  $and: [{ name: \"Mohamed\" }, { country: \"Sudan\" }]\n});\n\nNotice that name and country are case-sensitive.\nExercise:\n\nFind all students for whom Ashleigh is an assigned mentor.\nFind all students that have Michael as their only mentor\nFind students whose name is Mohamed OR Michael is their only mentor\nRead about the\n$in operator\nand use it to find students whose country is either Sudan or Ethiopia.\nLook at the other\nComparison Query Operators\nand the\nLogical Query Operators\nand use few of them.\n\nKey Concepts so far\nIn Mongo, a database contains collections that contain BSON\ndocuments. We can use the mongo shell to interact with our Mongo\ndatabases. The query documents are used to specify a selection filter using\nquery operators\nto search for documents in the collections.\n\nCheckpoint: Do you understand all the words highlighed in the last paragraph?\n\nNode with Mongo\nSo far we've been connecting to Mongo using the Mongo shell. Mongo has drivers\nfor most major programming languages but it's especially popular with NodeJS\napplications as its API and Query model is very close to JavaScript syntax and\npatterns.\nLet's start wiring Node with MongoDB as a datastore.\n\nFork and Clone the project\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop.\nrun npm install then npm run dev to run the application with autoreload -\nGo to the browser and make sure it's up and running.\n\nInstall the MongoDB Node.js Driver npm install mongodb --save\n\nLet's add an endpoint api/students that returns a json containing all the\nstudents that we've been saving to the database from the shell.\n\n\nGo to the file controllers/apiController, on top of the file, require the\nmodule\nconst MongoClient = require(\"mongodb\").MongoClient;\n\nthen add an endpoint for /students\nrouter.get(\"/students\", (req, res) => {\n  const mongoConnection = \"mongodb://localhost:27017/profile\";\n\n  MongoClient.connect(mongoConnection, (err, db) => {\n    const cursor = db.collection(\"students\").find({});\n    cursor.toArray((error, students) => {\n      db.close();\n      res.json(students);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nGo to your browser /api/students and you should see a JSON containing the\ndocuments we've added to the students collection earlier.\n\nExercise: Let's step through the previous code and understand it line by line.\n\nWhat is a Mongo conection string?\n\n\n[Connection String documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/) - The connection string follows this format: `mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]` - what parts do you have in our connection string right now?\nExercise\nNow let's change the api/posts to also use the mongo database instead of the\njson file under /data.\n\nFirst step is to save the posts in the database. Similar to what we did\nwith students collection, use the Mongo shell to create a new collection\ncalled posts and use insertMany to insert all the documents.\n\nChange the endpoint /api/posts to read its contents from the database (very\nsimilar code to what we wrote in /api/students endpoint). Go to\nhttp://localhost:3000/api/posts and make sure you see the posts. Update a\ndocument in the database (either check the documentation for\nupdate\nor use RoboMongo) and see if it gets reflected.\n\nOnce you have the endpoint running, delete the json data/posts.json.\n\nNow if you go to the root of your application http://localhost:3000, you\nwill encounter an error as it will still try to read from the file system but\nwe deleted the file. Update the / endpoint to also get the Posts from the\ndatabase.\n\n\nExercise Part 2: Refactor the code\nEven though our code does what's supposed to do, it has several issues. We have\na lot of duplicate code - both endpoints GET /api/posts and GET / do the\nsame call to the database and then do something with it. It's only that\nsomething (the callback) that is different so let's refactor the code to\neliminate duplication (DRY).\n\nThe variable mongoConnection is declared multiple times, that means that if\nthe connection string changes then we need to change multiple places causing\npossibilities of missing one instance and causing errors. Let's declare it\nonce and use it in the rest of the app.\n\nWhy is it bad to have duplicate code?\n\nExtract the Mongo calls to seperate functions. Extract the route for\n/api/students into a function named getStudents\n\nWhat will the function signature be?\n\nRemember the Single Responsibility Principle - the route handlers have\nmultiple responsibilities right now: Connecting to Mongo, getting the data\nthen sending it back as a response.\n\nMove the new function to a new file called helpers/db-client.js, export the\nfunctions and use them in the original file.\n\nDo you remember how we create modules and use them? module.exports and\nrequire.\n\nDo the same for the /posts\n\n\nExercise Part 3: Deploy our app\nLet's deploy our Database-Driven Application to Heroku. If you don't remember\nthe steps, refresh your memory from\nthe previous lesson.\nOnce you're finsihed, Go to your application on heroku and see if it is working\nproperly.\nIt should not be working.\nCan you have a guess on what went wrong? To see what's happening on the heroku\nserver, run heroku logs from the terminal and check the logs.\nMongo on Heroku\nHeroku, AWS and other cloud services allows us to use databases and other\nservices on the cloud without having to maintain physical servers making it easy\nto scale, monitor costs and build good solutions in general.\nWe've already used DynamoDB on AWS. This week, we'll do MongoDB.\n\nGo to Heroku dashboard\nhttps://dashboard.heroku.com\n\nClick on your app name in the dashboard. Go to Resources, under addons,\nsearch for mLab MongoDB and choose it. When you're prompted with this\nscreen - click on Provision.\n\n\n\nThe new MongoDB service will appear under Resources - you can click on it and it\nwill take you to a web interface to administer your MongoDB instance.\n\nGo to the Settings and click on Reveal Config Vars. You should see the\na variable called MongoDB_URI - that is the connection string for the MongoDB\ninstance on Heroku (on mLab used by Heroku).\n\n\nSo how can we use this connection string instead of our local one?\n\nEnvironment variables\nIn NodeJS, The process.env property returns an object containing the user\nenvironment. Environment variables allow us to configure different aspects of\nour application based on the environment where it's running - so for instance,\nwhen we run our application locally, we want to connect to the local MongoDB but\non Heroku, we want to connect to a different one.\nConnection strings are typically saved and used as Environment variables, other\ntypical uses are with passwords, secrets, URLs of other services etc... Anything\nthat is environment specific and that shouldn't live in the source code.\n\nSecurity tip: Never add passwords, connection strings or any sensitive\ninformation in your source code, always use an Environment variable.\n\nServices like Heroku and AWS can then use these environment variables to\nconfigure aspects of the application.\n\nWe've already used one Environment variable for Heroku before - what was it?\nExercise: Use the environment MongoDB_URI to connect to MongoDB on Heroku,\nbut fallback to localhost connection string if there is no environment\nvariable provided.\n\n\nCommit and push the changes to Heroku and see if it works.\n\nHomework\nRefer to the MongoDB/Node workshop for the Homework tasks -\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop\n\nRead https://www.upguard.com/articles/mysql-vs-mongodb\n\nResources\n\nWhy use a database\nDatabases and Collections\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/\nDocuments in MongoDB - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/\nPractice on a web Mongo shell\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb_terminal_online.php\nEnvironment Variables -\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js.html\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sql-comparison/\n\n"},"CONTRIBUTING.html":{"url":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nBefore starting, please read the following general guidelines and\nChecklist for a lesson.\nParticipate in the discussion if you'd like.\nThere are discussions\nabout each module and every class in a module, make sure to go through them (or\nadd a new issue/discussion point).\nTo contribute to the Code Your Future syllabus, fork and open a pull request to\nthis repository.\nContributions are strictly through approved Pull Requests, even for\nadministrators of the repo.\nSince this repository is the blueprint of our syllabus we allow different\ncohorts to adapt to their classes' needs, and also update their syllabus\nversions to reflect how the class goes.\nWe should always make sure master is relevant and up to date for future\nclasses with the feedback from the on-going teaching in each CYF chapter.\nLegacy versions\nMentors should point the students to the individual classes on Github (not the\ngitbook links) to allow them to get familiar with Git and Github, and to focus\non the individual class.
