Pay\nparticular attention to the technologies we'll be teaching you (JavaScript,\nReact, NodeJS) and the evolution in the last years\n\n\nHouse Rules\nHow we work?\nHow we treat each other?\n\n\n\nWelcome to MigraCode and to the world of Web Development!!!\nOperating Systems\nAn Operating System (OS) is a powerful, and usually large, program that controls and manages the hardware and software on a computer. All computers and computer-like devices require operating systems, including laptops, tablets, desktops, and smartphones. The OS performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.\nMost common operating systems for desktop and laptop computers are:\n\nMicrosoft Windows (Windows 95, Windows 7, Windows 10,...), \nLinux (Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu,..)\nmacOS\nChrome OS\nAndroid and iOS are operating systems for mobile devices.\n\nUnix\nUnix is ​​a family of operating systems. The first version was developed from 1969. Unix is ​​characterized by being portable and multitasking.\nNowadays, Unix operating systems are widely used in a multitude of devices that range from the most capable supercomputers to the most popular mobile phones, through the computers that we use daily at our desks. The philosophy of Unix systems is characterized by:\n\na hierarchical file system,\na large collection of small programs that can work in series,\nthe use of text files to store the data,\ntreating devices as files.\n\nLinux and MacOS are examples of Unix systems.\nLinux\nLinux is a family of Unix-like operating systems that use the Linux kernel.\nThe name comes from the original programmer, a student named Linus Torvals, who in 1991, completing the GNU tools developed by the GNU project of the Free Software Foundation, created the first version of this operating system.\nLinux development is one of the clearest examples of free, open source software development by a diverse community of programmers all over the world. Anyone can use the operating system, study it and modify it. The open source nature of Linux is protected by the GPL (GNU General Public License).\nUbuntu\nUbuntu is a Linux distribution. It is aimed at desktop users and its strengths are its ease of use and installation. Although the desktop is somewhat different from Windows or Mac OS, a user who is accustomed to any of the other operating systems will not have many problems becoming familiar with Ubuntu.\nUbuntu is based on a maintained distribution by a community called Debian. Debian's main goal is to create a robust operating system that includes the largest possible proportion of free programs.\nIf you are the ones that are using Ubuntu, an open-source operating system, you will see this sreen:\n\n  \n\n\nDemo of Ubuntu:\n\nThe fiendly Desktop\nThe filesystem: we can navigate through folders and files using File Manager\nUbuntu software: a tool to install software easily\n\nThe Command Line\nThe Command Line, also knows as Bash, Terminal or Shell (Línea de Comandos ó Símbolo de sistema in Spanish) is a way of controlling a computer based on a text interface. \n\nOk, but why I should use it?\n\nOnce you know the basics, will help you to interact with you computer faster\nSome software for developers shold be used from a terminal\nYou have more control to the software\nIt allow to create scripts (list of commands) and automate manual tasks\nIn movies they use it to be like a hacker\n\nHow do I use it on my computer?\nSo now that you know what the terminal can do for you, how do you use it? Please\nfind instructions for your operating system below. \n\nMacOS: You can find the Terminal.app in your Applications, in the folder Utilities. An alternative way to open the Terminal is to search with Spotlight and type in “terminal”. Select the application called terminal and press the return key. This should open up an app with a black background. When you see your username followed by a dollar sign, you’re ready to start using the command line.\nLinux: You can open Terminal by directly pressing [ctrl+alt+T] or you can search it up by clicking the “Dash” icon, typing in “terminal” in the search box, and opening the Terminal application. Again, this should open up an app with a black background. When you see your username followed by a dollar sign, you’re ready to start using the command line.\nWindows: Windows has its own Command Prompt, it is very similar to the Unix command line, but some commands are not exactly the same, find the main differences in this link. Because of these differences and with theobjective to learn UNIX commands, we can use the Git Bash. Go to the Windows \"Start\" button and search the program Git Bash, once you open it you will see a screen like this one:\n\n\nAfter you have followed the instructions, open a terminal and write ls, then press the Enter key. What do you see?\nCommonly used commands\nThere's a set of commands you should become comfortable with during the course to allow you to effectively move around the filesystem and write software on your laptop.\n\ncd - change directory. To move up into the parent directory use: cd ..\nls - list the contents of a directory. Can also be used as ls [directory_name] to list the contents of a specific directory without actually moving (with cd) to it\npwd - print the full location of your current directory\nmkdir [name] - create a new directory, with the given name after a space\ntouch [file_name] - create a new file, with the given name (don't forget to add the extension, like .css or .html)\nrm [file_name] - remove a file\nrm -r [directory_name] - remove a directory (and all files inside that directory)\n\nTo understand commands we need to understand the structure and how to look for help easily:\nCommand Syntax\nFlags are a way to set options and pass in arguments to the commands you run. Commands you run will change their behavior based on what flags are set. You should read the documentation of each command to know what flags are available.\nThink of flags as accessories. You have your basic command like rm that deletes file and if you give him -r it learns to delete folders, if you give him -f it gets powers and can delete no matter what, and if you give him -rf it, well, it can delete folders no matter what.\n\nGetting Help\nWhen you're stuck and need help with a Linux command, help is usually only a few keystrokes away! Help on most Linux commands is typically built right into the commands themselves, available through online help programs (“man pages” and “info pages”), and of course online.\n\nMore commands\nCommands for Navigating the filesystem\nThe first thing you usually want to do when learning about the Linux filesystem is take some time to look around and see what's there! These next few commands will: \n\na) Tell you where you are, \nb) take you somewhere else, and \nc) show you what's there. The following table describes the basic operation of the pwd, cd, and ls commands, and compares them to certain DOS commands that you might already be familiar with.\n\n\n\nWorking With Files and Directories\nThese commands can be used to: find out information about files, display files, and manipulate them in other ways (copy, move, delete).\n\nFinding things\nThe following commands are used to find files. “ls” is good for finding files if you already know approximately where they are, but sometimes you need more powerful tools such as these:\n\nOther Utilities\nHere are some other commands that are useful to know:\n\nSome tips to be a master using commands:\n\nAutocomplete: when you are writing the name of an existing command or folder, press TAB to automplete\nHistory: press up-arrow to see the last commands you executed, so you don't have to write again the most used commands\n\nExercises\nExercise T-1: Open a terminal and create the following structure:\n\nterminal-exercises-1\nsrc\ncss\nhtml\n\n\n\n\n\nTo check out we can run ls with R option (ls -R) from folder /terminal-exercises-1   \nExercise T-2: add files to the css and html folders, the final structure should be like:\n\nterminal-exercises-1\nsrc\ncss\nfile1.css\n\n\nhtml\nfile2.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise T-3: go to the folder /terminal-exercises-1, create a file with the name index.html, once created move it to the folder /html\nThe final structure should be like:\n\nterminal-exercises-1\nsrc\ncss\nfile1.css\n\n\nhtml\nfile2.html\nindex.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos and tutorials\nWatch, read and practice with these videos and tutorials:\n\nTutorial: Terminal for Beginners!\nBasic commands tutorial 10 mins\nIntro to Ubuntu and useful command tutorial 45 mins\n\nDevelopment Tools\nVisual Studio Code\nVisual Studio Code or VS Code is an IDE, \nIDE stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\". It is the software that you\nwill be using to write most of your code. It is designed to help you develop\nyour apps quickly, focusing on the problems that you need to solve instead of\nhaving to search Google for minor details.\nAuto-complete\nOne of the most important features of an IDE is that it provides\n\"auto-completion\". This means that it will give you suggestions of what you can\ncan write next, while you are typing something.\nFor example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can\nassign it to.\n\n  \n\n\nFile tree view\nThe reason why we call it \"Integrated\" is that you almost don't need to leave\nthe window to write your app. For example, creating, renaming and moving files\ncan be done directly from the IDE. This functionality can be achieved from\nsomething called a \"Tree view\", which you can usually find on the left side of\nyour IDE.\n\n  \n\n\nFinding files\nWhen working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly,\nwithout having to go through the tree view manually.\n\n  \n\n\nEnable formatting on save\n\nIn Visual Studio open the settings file (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_creating-user-and-workspace-settings)\nSearch for editor format\nSet editor.formatOnSave and editor.formatOnPaste to true\n\nUse the Terminal from Visual Code\nYou can open a Terminal in the same Visual Code window, just to to Terminal>New Terminal\nImportant: if you are using Windows, the default Terminal is the Windows console, follow this guide to open instead the Git Bash\nExtensions\nYou can install extensions to Visual Code to improve even more the management of your code.\nClick the Extensions option in the left navbar and install your favourite extensions (guide)\nRecommended extensions:\n\nBabel JavaScript\nCSS Intellisense\nvscode-file-peek\nbracket-pair-colorizer\ngitlens\nmarkdown-all-in-one\n\nOpen your VS project in a Browser with one click\nGit\nWe will use Git as our Version Control System (also known as Source Control).\nIt's like Dropbox for developers. But much better!\n\nWhat is \"version control\"? Version control is a system that records\nchanges to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific\nversions later.\nIt allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire\nproject back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last\nmodified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue\nand when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things\nup or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for\nvery little overhead.\nExtract from\nGit Pro book\n\nThis answer on StackOverflow by\nsi618 explains very well why we\nuse Version Control.\nSo what is Git? Git is one of many Version Control Systems available to use,\nand by far\nthe most popular.\nWhat is Github? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and\nshare your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.\n\n  \n\n\n\nGet Started\nIf Git is not installed, follow this tutorial from Github to setup Git\nOnce is installed set your username and email adress in Git\ngit config --global user.name \"Mona Lisa\"\ngit config --global user.email \"email@example.com\"\n\nA typical workflow\n\nIf you're basing your work from another project, the first step is typically\nto fork their repo.

We'll see many of its uses throughout the course.\nEach week, you're going to use Git to get a copy of your homework exercises, to submit your solutions, and to get feedback on your solutions. Today, you're going to learn how to do these things.\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this class, you should be able to:\n\nExplain why Git is a useful tool.\nGet a copy of your homework questions onto your computer.\n(To clone a repository).\n\n\nSave your answers, and send them to our volunteers.\n(To commit, fork a repository, and push changes).\n\n\nSee and respond to feedback on your homework.\n(To use GitHub's pull request workflows, and push further changes).\n\n\nExplore how a file has changed over time.\n(To use Git's history log).\n\n\n\n\nWhat problem does Git solve?\nGit is a version control tool, used to keep the history of changes, and make collaboration easier. It's used to solve many problems, but today we're going to focus on how it:\n\nHelps us to share information.\nEnables people to make their own changes to that information, and share it back.\nAllows us to make checkpoints so that we can save our work as we go along.\nAllows us to track how information has changed between each checkpoint, and go back to older versions of our work if we want to see what we tried before, or to undo changes.\nEnables us to try more things, because if they didn't work out, we can always go back to what we had working before, by going back to a checkpoint.\n\nVersioning\nWe use Git to track different versions of files.\nPerhaps you've had this experience before...\n\nYou've probably in the past saved a document in a file with \"draft\" in its name, and then another with \"version 1\" in its name, and eventually one called \"final\", and then \"really final\", and then \"final after feedback\". It can be hard to know what the latest one is, and to track what order the files came in. But we keep these files around, because they were useful, and we may want to check something from them.\nGit helps us to avoid this problem. Before we see how Git helps, let's try an exercise:\nExercise 1 (10 minutes)\nOpen these three links - they are different stages of a draft blog post about CodeYourFuture:\n\nfinal\nrevised\nv1\n\nTry to find all of the differences between these three documents. Can you work out which one is the finished one which was meant to go on the website?\nYou probably found it hard to see all of the differences (some were really small, like adding or removing a comma!), and non-obvious which is the most complete version!\nHow does Git help?\nImagine your teacher wanted everyone in the class to answer three questions and to send back the answers. What capabilities would we need in order to be able to do that?\nFirst, the teacher needs to be able to write the questions, and store them somewhere.\nWhen we're using Git, we write things down in files in a folder (these could be text files, Word documents, images, or really any kind of file). When we save these files, we say we're committing them, and we call the folder where we're saving them a repository (or repo for short).\n\nNext, the teacher needs to put the repository somewhere where the learners can get it. We call this pushing the repository. The teacher won't send a copy to each learner, but will put one copy somewhere on the Internet, and tell the learners where it is. The place the teachers on this course will be pushing to is a website called GitHub, but there are other websites they could push to if they wanted to. This is the difference between Git and GitHub - Git is a way of storing and sharing files, and GitHub is one website where you can use Git.\n\nThen, now that the teacher has pushed the questions, each learner needs to be able to get the questions onto their computer.\nWhen we're using Git, we call this cloning the teacher's repository (because we're making our own copy). After we've cloned the repository, we will have the same folder on our computer as the teacher created, committed, and pushed.\n\nThe Git Cheatsheet\nWe tend to do the same four or five things in Git over and over again, but it can be easy to forget them. There's a handy reference at Git Cheatsheet to help you remember.\nLet's walk through one of the sections together: \"I want to get code from a repo onto my computer (Cloning)\". It has a video, to show us what we should be doing, and explains each step in the text.\nWe'll use it in our next exercise:\nExercise 2 (15 minutes)\nVolunteers from Code Your Future have already pushed an example repository, so you're going to try to clone it from GitHub onto your computer.\nTry following the instructions labelled \"I want to get code from a repo onto my computer (Cloning)\" from the Git Cheatsheet. The repository we want to clone is https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-demo-repo.\nWhen you've finished the exercise, you should have file.txt open in VS Code.\nWhat did we just do?\n\nEach of you just cloned a repository which CodeYourFuture created onto your computer, and opened up your copy of one of the files. This is the process you're going to follow to get your homework every week.\nLet's do some homework (teacher-led demo)\nThe file you opened, file.txt, has a question in it. We're going to answer the question, and submit it as if it was our homework.\nLet's clone our repository to our computer:\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-demo-repo\nWe can edit the file in VS Code to answer the question, and save it like normal.\nAfter we've saved the file, if we open up GitHub Desktop, something interesting has changed. On the left, it now says \"1 changed file\", and on the right, it shows us what the change was. Things we've removed get a red background, and things we've added get a green background.\n(If you've changed a line, the old version will appear with a red background, and the new version with a green background).\n\nThis is a really useful way for us to check over our homework before submitting it. If we've accidentally deleted things, or changed things we didn't mean to, we can notice now, and un-do them by editing the file again.\nWhen we're happy with our change, we can press the \"Commit to main\" button. That tells Git \"This change is an interesting change, I want to keep it\". You don't need to wait until you've got your answers perfect before committing, in fact it's better to make lots of commits as you work - we'll come back to this in a bit!\nThis doesn't copy our change to any other computer - it won't go on GitHub - commiting is something we just do on our computer.\nExercise 3 (10 minutes)\nTry doing what your teacher just did:\n\nAnswer the question in file.txt in VS Code and save your changes.\nLook at the diff in GitHub desktop - does it look as you expect?\nMake a commit in your local repository.\n\nTeacher-led demo continues...\nNow, because we committed a change, our copy of the repository is different from CodeYourFuture's copy. GitHub Desktop now gives us a new button: \"Push origin\" (\"origin\" is what Git calls \"where I cloned this repository from\"). If we press it, it will try to send our change to the CodeYourFuture version.\nWe didn't have this button before, because even though we had changed the files, we hadn't committed any changes. There's an important distinction here: When we save files in VS Code, we store them in the file on our computer, but Git doesn't automatically commit them. It notices the changes (it showed them to us!), and asks us if we want to commit them. Only after we've committed them does it let us push them. We'll talk about when you want to commit later on today.\nSo, we're happy with our homework, we've committed it, let's try pushing it!\nForking\nGitHub Desktop just gave us a really useful warning, but it uses some words we haven't seen yet!\nWe just tried to push our changes to CodeYourFuture's copy of this repository. But we're not allowed to do that! Imagine if anyone could just push anything they wanted to our repository! Someone could accidentally delete all of the questions, or add the answers to all of the questions, or turn the HTML homework into a bunch of questions about vegetables!\nTo avoid this, we use something called a fork and something called a pull request.\nRemember when we cloned the repo, we pasted https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-demo-repo in as the place to clone from? Let's look at that:\n\nThis is saying \"On GitHub, the user CodeYourFuture has a repository called cyf-demo-repo, I want that\".\nGitHub lets you host your own copy of the repository on GitHub too! If your username is EagerLearner, can you guess what URL your repository would be at?\nThat's right, https://github.com/EagerLearner/cyf-demo-repo!\n\nThis is called a fork. It's a copy of the repository, where you're allowed to make changes. So when GitHub Desktop just asked us \"Do you want to fork this repository?\", what it's really saying is \"You're not allowed to make changes to CodeYourFuture's repository, would you like to make your own copy on GitHub where you are allowed to make changes, and put your changes there?\"\nThat sounds like exactly what we want to do, so we'll click the \"Fork This Repository\" button.\nThen GitHub asks us whether we want to fork \"To contribute to the parent project\" (i.e. because we want to work with CodeYourFuture) or \"For my own purposes\" (i.e. because we want to do our own thing apart from CodeYourFuture). We want to work with CodeYourFuture, so we'll select \"To contribute to the parent project\" and press Continue.\nNow if we press \"Push origin\", it will copy our changes to our fork on GitHub.\n\nIf you forget this, it's in the cheatsheet! Check out the \"I want to send my code to volunteers (Pushing)\" section.\nMaking a Pull Request\nNow that we've pushed our homework to our fork, we need to tell CodeYourFuture about it, so that the volunteers know to look at it!\nWe do this with something called a pull request. This is a slightly weird name, in the context of homework.\nNormally, when people push changes to a fork on GitHub, they're doing so because they want the person who owns the repository to look at the changes, and pull the changes into their repository. For example, this webpage we're reading the syllabus on right now is hosted on GitHub, and if someone spots a typo, they can fix it, push it to their fork, and request for CodeYourFuture to pull their change into CodeYourFuture's version (hence the name a pull request - \"requesting to pull in changes\").\nWe call pulling someone's change into a repository \"merging\" the change, because we're merging what we're pulling into our repo with what we had before.\nFor submitting homework, every week you're going to create a pull request, and a volunteer will look at it and give you feedback, but we won't be pulling your homework into CodeYourFuture's copy (then the next student would have the answers when they tried to read the questions!). You'll be creating pull requests, but we won't actually merge your changes into the repository.\nIn GitHub Desktop, if you open the Branch menu, and click \"Create Pull Request\", it will open your web browser at GitHub, and show you the changes you're about to make a pull request for. This is another great time to check that you're happy with your homework (if you're not, go back to VS Code, make your changes, commit them, push them to origin again, and refresh this page).\nIf you're happy, press the \"Create pull request\" button. Fill in the details in the form, so that the volunteers know what they're meant to be reviewing, and press \"Create pull request\".\nNow there's a pull request that volunteers can look at! They can see who made the pull request, and see all the changes you've made.\nExercise 4 (15 minutes)\nMake yourself a pull request with your change!\n\nTry to push your changes, make a fork, and then actually push your changes.\nMake your first pull request!\n\nIf you get stuck, check out the cheatsheet :)\nExercise 5 (5 minutes)\nThere's another file in the repository you've cloned, other-file.txt.\n\nOpen it\nAnswer the question in the file\nCommit\nand Push\n\nNotice a couple of things are different this time!\nIt didn't ask you to fork the repository - that's because you already have a fork you're allowed to push to.\nYou may also notice that if you click the \"Create Pull Request\" menu item, it brings you to a different page. It doesn't have a \"Create Pull Request\" button, it has a \"View Pull Request\" button. This is because if you already have a pull request open, when you push more changes, it will update your existing pull request.\nThis is useful for responding to feedback you get on your homework. There are ways to open more than one pull request at a time (using something called branches), which we'll learn about in the future, but for now, one should do!\nGetting feedback\nWhen you've made your pull request, our volunteers will be notified. They will look at your changes. When they are done, you will get an email. Here are some of the things they may do:\n\nMake comments with suggestions, either about a particular bit of code, or about the whole pull request.\nAdd labels to the pull request (e.g. marking it as complete, or unfinished).\n\nIf they give you suggestions, you should try to implement the suggestions, and push a new commit. If you're confused, struggling, or find them unclear, you can respond to the comment with a comment of your own, or ask on Slack.\nHistory\nOne useful features of Git is how it stores your commits. In GitHub Desktop, if you open the History tab, you can see a list of each commit that's been made in the repository, with the oldest at the bottom and the newest at the top.\nIf you click on one of the commits, you'll see the changes that happened in it. This can be really useful to understand how the repository evolved to how it looks today. It can also help us to find out when bugs were introduced!\nYou can always see an old version of a file by looking in the Git history, and if you want to get it back, you can just copy and paste it from the history view into your text editor.\nWhen to commit, push, and make a pull request\nYou should commit often! Every time you think you've done something you may want to look at again, you should make a commit.\nLet's say you've made a website, and it generally looks about right, but you were thinking of adding some colour, or an animation. Before you do that, make a commit, because then if you break some of the CSS by trying to add an animation, you can always undo it.\nOr if you want to try out a few different colours, make a commit for each colour, and then you can easily see what colours you tried out, and compare them.\nTeacher-led demo: Changing the colours\nA volunteer made a small website, which we can find in https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/SampleGitWebsite\nThey had a few different colour combinations they were trying to choose between. Because they made commits for each choice, we can look at their choices, and try them each out.\nIf they hadn't made all of those commits, they probably would've forgotten at least one of the colours, and we wouldn't be able to see them now. Maybe they would've lost the perfect colour! Thankfully, we can look in the git history and see each step along the way.\nSimilarly, you don't need to have finished everything before you push - in fact, it can be better to push lots! If your computer crashes, or you accidentally delete your files, or you want to work on homework on someone else's computer, you can always get back anything that you've pushed to GitHub. So commit often, and push often!\nYou also don't need to have finished all of your homework in order to make a pull request! If you've been struggling with one question, you can make a pull request and ask for help (you can even link to it on Slack! It will help the volunteers to help you, because they will be able to see exactly the code you're struggling with). Or if you've done most of the homework, but are struggling with a few questions, a volunteer can look at what you've done and help you out - but only if they can see your code!\nCommit often, push often, and make pull requests early!\nYou may notice that your commits all have messages like \"Update file.txt\", whereas the ones before you started editing have different messages.\nCommit messages can be really useful to understand what a change did without having to read the whole thing. Let's try out an exercise to help us understand this:\nExercise 6 (10 minutes)\n\nClone https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/git-log-example (if you forgot how, check the cheatsheet\nHave a read of the file called README.md. See if you can find a problem in the file.\nLook through the history in GitHub Desktop. See if you can work out when and why the problem was introduced.\nMake a pull request fixing the problem.\n\nExercise 7 (5 minutes)\nRemember earlier we looked at three blog posts? They're actually in a repository on GitHub! https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/git-draft-blog-post-example\nClone the repository and take a look. Can you find all of the differences between them now? Can you tell which was the finished version? How much easier/harder is this than it was without Git?\nCommit messages\nIf you looked through the history of the Git repository, you may have been able to see where the problem came in just from the commit message, without having to look at the changes that were actually made. If the commit messages were all just \"Update file.txt\", that would've been much harder!\nWhen we make commits in Git, we try to give clear, helpful messages, describing what changed, and why. (The why is really important! You can always work out what changed by reading the change itself, but it's much harder to work out why if no one wrote it down!)\nThere is a convention when using Git to use the following format for commit messages:\nOne sentence summary\n\nLonger explanation of how, the reasons, exceptions, or anything that may be surprising.\nThis may be many sentences, and keep going for a long time.\nTry to use this format when making your own commits. GitHub Desktop tries to encourage this by having two boxes above the \"Commit to main\" button - one which is just one line, and one where you can put lots of lines.\n\nExplaining why we're making the change can help people in the future to understand why things look the way they do, and what's important not to change.\nHomework going forwards\nFor the next four modules, most weeks your homework is going to be to clone a repository from GitHub, write some code, and make a Pull Request with the code.\nGlossary\nWe introduced a few new things in this class, and it can be a bit confusing to know which is which:\n\nGit is a system for storing changes to files in commits, and sharing them between different computers. There are also other systems which do this, but Git is the most popular one.\nGitHub is a website which will store a copy of your Git repository, and allow you to clone it, and push changes to it. There are also other websites which can do this, but GitHub is the most popular one.\nGitHub Desktop is a program made by GitHub to allow you to use Git easily from your computer. Later in the course, we will use other programs to use Git, too.\n\nHomework\n1) Tell us about you - using Github!

We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form, and sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community activity.\nHarassment\nHarassment is a form of discrimination under the Equality Act 2010. Discrimination which is against the Equality Act is unlawful. This means action can be taken against you the civil courts.\nHarassment may be verbal, non-verbal or physical. Examples of unwanted conduct are:\n\nVerbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion\nOffensive and suggestive remarks (including emails, messages and other electronic communications, posters, objects, written materials or graffiti)\nIntimate questions\nFoul or obscene language\nInnuendo and derogatory comments\nJokes, banter, teasing, nicknames, ridicule or insults\nInappropriate comments about dress, appearance, physique or abilities\nPersistent requests for social activities (after it has been made clear that such requests are unwelcome) or other persistent unwelcome attention of a personal nature\nWhistling, winking and suggestive or offensive gestures\nDeliberate ignoring or isolation of a community member\nInappropriate physical contact (including touching, standing too close, pinching, pushing and grabbing)\nSustained disruption of talks, working groups or other events\nUnwelcome sexual attention or suggestive behaviour (which the harasser may perceive as harmless)\nThreats, assault or coercing sexual acts\nRacist, sexist, homophobic or ageist jokes, or derogatory or stereotypical remarks about a particular ethnic or religious group or gender\nMocking, mimicking or belittling a person's disability\nSexual images in public spaces\nDeliberate intimidation, stalking, or following\nHarassing photography or recording\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour\n\nA person may also be harassed even if they were not the intended \"target\". For example, a person may be harassed by racist jokes about a different ethnic group if the jokes create an offensive environment.\nOur position is that no harassment of any kind should take place and all community members have a responsibility to ensure at all times that their own behaviour does not offend others.\nThe Equality Act defines harassment as where behaviour is meant to or has the effect of either violating dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. This means it’s harassment even if the harasser didn’t mean to offend or intimidate, as long as the harassment has one of the above effects.\nBullying\nBullying is any behaviour or action (whether physical, verbal or non-verbal) that is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting intended to undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient. It also includes an abuse or misuse of power, deliberately setting an individual up to fail and unjustified intimidation.\nIn addition to the examples listed for harassment above, bullying  may also include but is not limited to:\n\nShouting in public\nPersistent or unfair criticism\nOstracising people\nPhysical or psychological threats and instilling fear\nSpreading malicious rumours\nConstantly undervaluing effort/achievement\nWithholding information\n\nResponsibilities\nCommunity members have a responsibility to behave in a way that is not offensive to others and to acknowledge that views and opinions held by others may not always coincide with their own.\nReporting\nIf you are being harassed or bullied or notice that this is happening to someone else, or have any other concerns, please contact Vincent van Grondele at vincent@openculturalcenter.org. We will not take any actions without your agreement and consent and we will always operate anonymously. \nEnforcement\nCommunity members are asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.\nWe retain the right to take any actions to keep the community a welcoming environment for all participants.

If you want to refresh your memory, read this quick guide to the HTML syntax.\nExercise (1 minute)\nAll together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example:\n\n  Learning HTML\n  Get to know the HTML basics.\n  Read Article\n\n\nWhich parts are the Tags and which parts are the Attributes.\nHTML Tags\nHTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called \"nesting\" tags or creating an HTML \"tree\". Between the opening  tag and the closing  tag there are three other tags. We call these \"child\" tags, because they have a parent-child relationship.\n\nExercise (5 minutes)\nAs a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in the following example.\n\n  Learning HTML\n  \n    Author:\n    Code Your Future\n  \n  Get to know the HTML basics.\n  Read Article\n\n\nExample HTML/CSS Project\nIn today's class, we will begin adapting styles on this example website. We'll review some of the HTML/CSS basics you already encountered during your application process and learn some new techniques. By the end of the third lesson, we will have worked together to improve the example site on the left so that it looks like the screenshot on the right.\n\n \n\n\n \n\nThe example website you'll begin working with is available on this Code Your Future GitHub repository -\nBikes for Refugees. Fork the repository to your personal account and then clone the repository\nExercise (5 minutes)\nSpend a few minutes exploring the .html and .css files for this page. Why don't we put everything in one file?\nSemantic HTML\nWhen writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Wikipedia\n\nWe'll cover the following semantic tags:\n\n\n\nThe role=\"main\" attribute\n\n\n\n\nExercise (10 minutes)\nDetermine where to place these new Tags and Attributes in the index.html file. Who benefits when we write \"semantic\" HTML?\nCSS Selectors\nDuring your application process, you became familiar with CSS selectors. We'll review the basic selectors and then practice combining these to modify our button styles.\n\nIf you want to review the selectors, read the Common Selectors section of this page.\n\nExercise (10 minutes)\nMake the blue buttons on the page red (#ce5f31). The white button, which says \"Volunteer\", should remain white but the text should change to red.\nPseudo Classes\nYou can assign CSS rules to a class like this:\n.btn {\n  background: #ce5f31;\n}\n\nThere are also things called \"pseudo\" classes. In this section, we'll introduce you to the common pseudo classes for assigning styles to interactions, such as moving your mouse over a link.\n\n\"pseudo\" is a fancy word for \"fake\". We call them \"pseudo\" classes because they're not really there in the HTML, but the browser knows what to do with them.\n\nHere's an example of a pseudo class which changes the color of a link when the mouse moves over it.\n.btn:hover {\n  background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\nNot everyone uses a mouse. Some users will prefer a keyboard, where they can hit tab to move between links on a page. So that they can see where they are, you should add effects to the :focus pseudo class too.\n.btn:hover,\n.btn:focus {\n  background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\nExercise (10 minutes)\nWork in pairs and use the pseudo classes to make the background color of the red buttons change when in a \"hover\" or \"focus\" state. See if you can make the white \"Volunteer\" button change to a different background without effecting the red buttons.\nBox Model\nIn CSS, everything is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around this box can be modified with properites that we call margins, borders and padding. Here's a diagram showing what the box looks like.\n\nExercise (10 minutes)\nWork in pairs and use the margin and padding rules to spread your navigation links out a bit wider. There should be a small gap between them and enough padding so that the border is not too tight on the text.\nBorders\nYou may have noticed that the border you added to the navigation links causes the links to jump around when you move your mouse over them. That's because the border is adding to the width of the box model, pushing the others to the side.\nYou can also set a transparent border, so that it takes up the space without showing a visible border.\n.navlink {\n  border: 1px solid transparent;\n}\n\nExercise (10 minutes)\nUse a transparent border so that the width of each navigation menu item stays the same even when it is hovered or focused.\nCSS Project (60 minutes+)\nIn this repository you will find a CSS Project for you to complete using what you've learnt so far today.\nWork in pairs to complete all the mistakes in the project and fix them.\nZoo Project\nHomework\n1) Advanced CSS Selectors\n1.1) Read about CSS Selectors (1 Hour)\nRead this article about CSS Selectors\n1.2) CSS Diner (3 hours)\nThis online game will help you learn Advanced CSS Selectors.\nYou should complete every level before moving onto the next part of the homework.

To ensure we're presenting a website that's easy to use on any device, we use Responsive Web Design techniques to modify how content is displayed depending on the viewport.\n\nExercise: As a group, let's brainstorm as many devices as we can think of which might access the websites we build.\n\nSee how much variety there is in viewport sizes.\nMedia Queries\nAs you learned in your homework assignment, media queries help us change the display of our content depending on the size of the viewport. Let's review what you learned and break down a media query:\n@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n  body {\n    background: red;\n  }\n}\n\nIn this media query, we're assigning a red background color to the  element whenever the viewport is larger than 900px, and we're viewing on a screen.\n\n@media starts the media query\nscreen tells it to apply these styles to screen displays. Other displays\nmight be print, for when a webpage is being printed.\n(min-width: 900px) tells it to apply these styles when the viewport is\nlarger than 900px\n\nFinally, we wrap all of our styles for this media query in brackets ({ and }), just like a CSS rule.\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, reduce the size of the \"Bikes for Refugees\" text so that it fits on a small screen (320px). But make sure it increases in size on larger screens.\nExercise: The two buttons in the jumbotron don't fit on the same line on small screens around 320px wide. Can you adjust their size so that they fit on the same line?\n\nFlexbox\nFlexbox is a name for a set of CSS layout rules which are supported in newer browsers. They allow you to apply rules to elements to place them side-by-side and re-arrange them. You just specify how you want your elements arranged and the browser will scale this arrangement depending on the screen size and device used for viewing.\nMost flexbox rules are applied to the container, to tell it how to arrange its children. However, there are some rules that can be applied to children as well.\nYou can see all the rules that can be applied to both the container and the children here:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\nExercise: Continue editing the \"Bike for refugees\" website by adding 3 boxes below Jumbotron, and using Flexbox, make sure they are arranged like in the sketch below:\n\n\nYou can start with something like the below, by just adding a container, and the 3 text pieces within it. Try to use flexbox to position the text elements within the container to match the picture:\n\n  \n  Check availability\n  Donate bikes\n  Volunteer with us\n\n\n\nOnce that's done you can move on to creating boxes for each individual text piece, and again, using flexbox to position the text piece in the middle of its box.\n\nLet's take a break from flexbox for a minute. Do you remember the :first-child psuedo class? There's a :last-child psuedo class as well.\n\nExercise: See if you can use these psuedo classes to give the left box a grey background (#ddd) and the right box a grey border (1px solid #ddd). Use this screenshot to guide you.\n\nHomework\nReadings and games:\nFlexbox Froggy\n\nFlexbox Froggy is a really fun way of learning how Flexbox works.\nYou should complete all the levels\n\nKarma-clone\n\nFrom the Exercises Repo complete the exercise in the folder /week2/1-website/ by following the steps\nPush  the changes to your repository in Github\n\nWorkshop (Saturday)\n\nFinish the Karma-clone project to look as awesome as you can\nPush  the changes to your repository in Github\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\n(Est. 1 hour) You may remember Bootstrap from your application process.

It is sometimes called a \"design system\", \"style guide\", or \"pattern library\", and will usually consist of three things:\n\nBrand guidelines define the appropriate typography, colors and logos to use.\nComponents define re-usable code snippets for common requirements, like navigation menus.\nHelpers define additional code tools to construct the site, like layout grids.\n\nThe main goals of a design framework are to ensure design consistency and avoid writing the same code twice.\nBootstrap 4\nBootstrap is CSS and JavaScript code that we load in our HTML pages. Bootstrap's documentation describes how to write HTML code that fits the Bootstrap components, including a grid layout as well as several components.\n\nExercise: Fork this repository and follow the instructions in the readme to create a new page and add a card component to it.\nExercise: Perform a group exercise exploring the git workspace. Then create a branch, commit your new page, and issue a pull request. Once all the pull requests are merged, switch back to the master branch and update your copy.\n\nDid you know there are other open-source HTML/CSS frameworks you can try? Two popular ones are Bulma and Foundation.\nPersonal Websites\nOver the last two weeks, you've been building personal websites as part of your homework. Now we want you to take those websites and apply the knowledge you've learned to make them as good as you can. Some ideas:\n\nAdd Bootstrap 4 to your site and use some of the components.\nUse re-usable class names to reduce your CSS code.\nValidate your HTML code to find and fix problems.\nAdd a second page and link to it from your first page.\nTry to style the first article differently so that it stands out from the rest.\n\nBy the end, you should have created a repository for your site on GitHub with all the commits you've made.\nRetrospective\nAt the end of each module, we'll have a retrospective.

If you don't see this try to install it!\nWindows and Mac users:\nDownload the installer (.msi or .pkg) from https://nodejs.org/en/download\nLinux (Ubuntu) users:\nRun the following commands in your terminal:\n  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -\n  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nSource: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nHello World\nVariables\nString concatenation\nStrings\nNumbers as integers\nNumbers as decimals\nFunctions\nCalling functions inside functions\n\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this class, you should be able to:\n\nUse console.log() to print information to the console\nList and describe the different primitive data types in JS\nUse typeof to find the type of a variable\nAssign data to variables using let and const\nWrite, call and evaluate functions in JavaScript\nManipulate strings with concatenation and interpolation techniques\nManipulate numbers with mathematical operators using the Math library\nDefine the difference between console.log() and return\nCall functions within functions\nSearch and read documentation to help when you are stuck\n\n\nHello World\nIt is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any language is make it output 'Hello world!'.\nWe'll do this in JavaScript, using a command called console.log(). The console.log() method writes a message to the console.\nThe console is a tool which is mainly used to log information - it's useful for testing purposes.\nExercise A (10 minutes)\n(This exercise will help you understand how to run a basic JS script and explore the different ways you can run JS code)\n\nUpdate your first exercise-A.js script in the folder week-1/InClass in the Javascript/Core Module 1 repository you forked before\nType console.log(\"Hello World!\")\nRun this script by going with the terminal to your directory and write node exercise-A.js, you will see the result of the console.log in the terminal\n\nExercise B (5 minutes)\n(This exercise will help you expand your understanding of console.log)\n\nUpdate the file exercise-B.js script in the folder week-1/InClass\nWrite 10 statements like these, but in different languages.\n\nFor example:\nHalo, dunia! // Indonesian\nCiao, mondo! // Italian\nHola, mundo! // Spanish\n\nVariables\nWhen you write code, you'll want to create shortcuts to data values so you don't have to write out the same value every time.\nWe can use a variable to create a reference to a value. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.\nBefore you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with let and const keywords as follows.\nlet greeting = \"Hello world\";\n\nconsole.log(greeting);\n\nconst name = \"Irina\";\n\nconsole.log(name);\n\nThe program above will print \"Hello world\" to the console. Notice how it uses the value assigned to the variable greeting.\nExercise C (5 minutes)\n\nUpdate the file exercise-C.js script in the folder week-1/InClass\nAdd a variable greeting to js1-week1.js and assign a greeting of your choice to the variable\nPrint your greeting to the console 3 times. You should see your greeting 3 times on the console, one on each line.\n\nStrings\nIn programming there are different types of data. You've used one data type already: string.\nComputers recognise strings as a sequence of characters but to humans, strings are simply lines of text.\nconst message = \"This is a string\";\n\nNotice that strings are always wrapped inside of quote marks. We do this so that the computer knows when the string starts and ends.\nYou can check that the data is a string by using the typeof operator:\nconst message = \"This is a string\";\nconst messageType = typeof message;\n\nconsole.log(messageType); // logs 'string'\n\nExercise D (5 minutes)\n\nUpdate the file exercise-D.js script in the folder week-1/InClass\nWrite a program that:\ncreates a variable called colors\nassigns colors \"blue\" and \"yellow\" as a comma separate string to colors\nlogs the type colors using typeof.\n\n\nWhat is the typeof a number?\n\nString concatenation\nYou can add two strings together using the plus operator (+) or string interpolation.\nString interpolation is a useful JavaScript feature that allows you to put variables directly into a string:\n// Here is an example using the plus operator to concat strings\nconst greetingStart = \"Hello, my name is \";\nconst name = \"Daniel\";\n\nconst greeting = greetingStart + name;\n\nconsole.log(greeting); // Logs \"Hello, my name is Daniel\"\n\n// Here is example using the String interpolation to concat strings\nconst greetingStart = \"Hello\";\nconst name = \"Daniel\";\n\nconst greeting = `${greetingStart}, my name is ${name}`;\n\nconsole.log(greeting); // Logs \"Hello, my name is Daniel\"\n\nExercise E (5 mins)\n\nUpdate the file exercise-E.js script in the folder week-1/InClass\nWrite a program that logs a message with a greeting and your name using the two concatenation methods we used\n\nNumbers as integers\nThe next data type we will learn is number.\nUnlike strings, numbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes.\nconst age = 30;\n\nYou can use mathematical operators to calculate numbers:\nconst sum = 10 + 2; // 12\nconst product = 10 * 2; // 20\nconst quotient = 10 / 2; // 5\nconst difference = 10 - 2; // 8\n\nExercise F (10 mins)\n\nUpdate the file exercise-F.js script in the folder week-1/InClass\nCreate two variables numberOfStudents and numberOfMentors\nLog a message that displays the total number of students and mentors\n\nExpected result\nNumber of students: 15\nNumber of mentors: 8\nTotal number of students and mentors: 23\n\nNumbers as decimals\nNumbers can be integers (whole numbers) or floats (numbers with a decimal).\nconst preciseAge = 30.612437;\n\nNumbers with decimals can be rounded to the nearest whole number using the Math.round function:\nconst preciseAge = 30.612437;\nconst roughAge = Math.round(preciseAge); // 31\n\nExercise G (15 mins)\n\nUpdate the file exercise-G.js script in the folder week-1/InClass\nUsing the variables provided in the exercise calculate the percentage of mentors and students in the group (percentages must be a rounded to the nearest integer)\nUsing online documentation, what other things can you do with the Math library? Pick one thing on your table that you can do other than Math.round and prepare an explanation for the rest of the class\n\nExpected result\nPercentage students: 65%\nPercentage mentors: 35%\n\nFunctions\nFunctions are blocks of code that can do a task as many times as you ask them to. They take an input and return an output.\nHere's a function that doubles a number:\nfunction double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n}\n\nTo use the function we need to:\na) call it with an input and\nb) do something with the returned value, for example assigning it to a variable\nconst result = double(2);\n\nconsole.log(result); // 4\n\nThe input given to a function is called a parameter.\nA function can take more than one parameter:\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nWhen you write a function (sometimes called declaring a function) you assign names to the parameters inside of the parentheses (()). Parameters can be called anything.\nThis function is exactly the same as the on above:\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n  return num1 + num2;\n}\n\nExercise H (20 minutes)\n\nUpdate the file exercise-H.js script in the folder week-1/InClass\nDesign and create a function that:\ntakes in more than one input\nuses string concatenation\nthis means adding two strings together\nperforms some form of operation on a number\nuses return to return a string\n\n\nAdd a comment above your function to explain what it does\nCall your function and run your script\nWhat's the difference between a return and console.log?\nWhen would you choose to use functions over the way we have been scripting so far?\n\nCalling functions inside functions\nFunctions are very powerful.\n\nYou can write more than one line of code inside of functions.\nYou can use variables inside of functions.\nYou can call other functions inside of functions!\n\nfunction getAgeInDays(age) {\n  return age * 365;\n}\n\nfunction createGreeting(name, age) {\n  const ageInDays = getAgeInDays(age);\n  const message =\n    \"My Name is \" + name + \" and I was born over \" + ageInDays + \" days ago!\";\n  return message;\n}\n\nExercise I (20 mins)\n\nUpdate the file exercise-I.js script in the folder week-1/InClass\nWrite a function that returns the year someone is born given their age as input\nUsing the answer from step 1, write a function that takes someone's name and age as input and returns a string that states the person's name and year they were born in a sentence\n\nGlossary\n\nConsole: a place on your computer to run scripts or commands from\nCommand: something that you type on your computer which performs an operation that your computer does\nDirectory: another word for \"folder\" on your computer\nParameter: a placeholder for values you can pass into functions\nPrimitive type: a built-in type in JavaScript (e.g. strings and numbers are primitive types in JavaScript)\nScript: a file that contains a program\nTerminal: another word for \"console\"\n\nHomework\n\nFrom the Javascript/Core Module 1 repository review and finish all exercises in the folder week-1/InClass\nComplete all of the exercises in the folder week-1/Homework\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\nComplete the Homework Form, to notify mentors and add comments and questions about the exercises\n\nPractice Day (Saturday)\n\nCheck together, solve doubts and fix the Homework exercises\n[Optional] Complete the exercises in the folder week-1/Extra\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\n\n"},"js-core/week-05/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core/week-05/lesson.html","title":"Week 5 - Expressions and loops","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core I - 2\nContents\n\nExpressions\nBooleans\nComparison Operators\nConditionals\nLogical Operators\nLoops\nArrays\nExtra exercises\n\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this class, you should be able to:\n\nWhat are expressions and statements (and what's the difference)?\nDefine what expressions and statements are and describe the difference\nDefine what was a conditional is\nDefine what for and while loops are and define the difference\nWrite an if statement using a conditional\nDefine comparator operators and list the different types\nUse comparator operators in an if statement\nDefine what a logical operator is and give examples\nDescribe what an array is and write code that interacts with them\n\n\nExpressions\nIn JavaScript, there are expressions and statements. We will use these words frequently to describe code.\nExpression\nAn expression returns a value. Sometimes we will say that an expression evaluates to a value.\nThe following are all examples of expressions:\n1 + 1; // returns 2\n(\"hello\"); // returns \"hello\"\n2 * 4; // returns 8\n\"Hello\" + \"World\"; // returns \"HelloWorld\"\n\nWe can take the value produced by an expression and assign it to a variable. That line of code would be called a statement.\nExpressions can also contain variables.\nfunction greetingPlanet() {\n  const planet = \"Earth\";\n  return `Hello ${planet}`; // returns Hello Earth\n}\n\nYou can also use expressions inside a string interpolation or as a return value.\nconsole.log(`2 + 4 is ${2 + 4}`); // 2 + 4 is 6\n\nfunction double(num) {\n  return num * 2; // expression being returned\n}\n\nStatement\nA statement is some code that performs an action. Here are some examples:\nconst sum = 1 + 1; // action: assigns result of `1 + 1` to variable `sum`\nconst greeting = \"hello\"; // action: assigns result of the expression \"hello\" to variable `greeting`\nconsole.log(2 * 4); // action: logs the result of `2 * 4` to the console\nsayGreeting(greeting); // action: calls the function `sayGreeting` with the parameter `greeting`\n\nThere are some other different types of statements that we will learn in the coming weeks.\nYou can run node by itself, which will open a node console, also called a Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL).\nThis console allows you to run expressions in the console line by line and is a great way of testing bits of code before writing it in a script.\nExercise A (5 mins)\nIn your VS Code terminal, run the command node and run the following expressions. What are their outputs? Is there anything you didn't expect? (To exit the node REPL, you have to click Ctrl+d or Cmd+D on Mac)\n\n1 + 2\n\"hello\"\nlet favouriteColour = \"purple\"\nfavouriteColour\nconsole.log(favouriteColour)\n\nBooleans\nThere is another primitive type in JavaScript known as a boolean value. A boolean is either true or false, and it should be written without quotes.\nlet codeYourFutureIsGreat = true;\nlet thisIsATerribleClass = false;\n\nExercise B (10 mins)\n\nIn a node REPL, what is the typeof a true or false?\nPair up and correct the following function so that the output returns \"You've given me a bool, thanks!\"\n\nfunction boolChecker(bool) {\n  if (typeof bool === ) {\n    return \"You've given me a bool, thanks!\";\n  }\n\n  return \"No bool, not cool.\";\n}\n\nboolChecker(true);\n\n\nAs a class, can you step through the function and explain what each line does?\n\nComparison Operators\nIn the previous exercise, you used an expression that returns a boolean value. This was possible because of the comparison operator ===. Using a comparison operator will always return a boolean value.\nConditionals\nLike humans, computer programs make decisions based on the information given to them. Conditionals are a way of representing these decisions in code (remember, you saw this in a previous exercise!)\nFor example:\n\nIn a game, if the player has 0 lives, then the game is over\nIn a weather app, if rain is forecast, a picture of rain clouds is shown\n\nThe most common type of conditional is the if statement.\nAn if statement runs some code if a condition is met. If the condition is not met, then the code will be skipped.\nlet isHappy = true;\n\nif (isHappy) {\n  console.log(\"I am happy\");\n}\n\nThe code in paratheses - e.g. (isHappy) - is the condition. The condition can be any expression. The following are all valid conditions:\n// boolean value\nif (true) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// variable assigned to boolean value\nlet isHappy = true;\nif (isHappy) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// equality operator returns a boolean value\nif (1 + 1 === 2) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// comparison operator returns a boolean value\nif (10 > 5) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// function call returns boolean value\nif (greaterThan10(5)) {\n  // do something\n}\n\nAn if statement runs code when a condition is met. What if the condition is not met? Sometimes you want to run an alternative bit of code.\nAn if...else statement also runs code when the condition is not met.\nlet isHappy = true;\n\nif (isHappy) {\n  console.log(\"I am happy &#x1F604;\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"I am not happy &#x1F622;\");\n}\n\nYou can use else if to handle multiple conditions.\nvar age = 24;\nif (age >= 65) {\n    console.log(\"John is an old guy.\")\n} else if (age \nExercise C (5 mins)\nCan you explain what this function does line by line? What happens when you pass in a string?\nfunction numberChecker(num) {\n  if (num > 20) {\n    return `${num} is greater than 20`;\n  } else if (num === 20) {\n    return `${num} is equal to 20`;\n  } else if (num \nExercise D (10 mins)\nCreate a function that gives you a message depending on your mood! It should:\n\ntake one input\nreturn \"Good job, you're doing great!\" if you pass in \"happy\"\nreturn \"Every cloud has a silver lining\" if you pass in \"sad\"\nreturn \"Beep beep boop\" if you pass in a number\nreturn \"I'm sorry, I'm still learning about feelings!\" if you pass in anything else\n\nLogical Operators\nThere are three logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT).\nThey let you write expressions that evaluate to a boolean value.\nSuppose you want to test if a number is bigger than 3 and smaller than 10. We can write this, using different logical operators.\nlet num = 10;\n\nfunction satisfiesRequirements(num) {\n  if (num > 3 && num \nWe can test expressions with logical operators in a node console too.\nExercise E (5 mins)\nType the following expressions into your node REPL and note the output. Anything you didn't expect?\n\nlet num = 10\nnum > 5 && num \nnum \nfalse || true\n!true\nlet greaterThan5 = num > 5\n!greaterThan5\n!(num === 10)\n\nExercise F (15 mins)\nIn pairs, write a function that checks a username is of an acceptable format for a user type. The function must:\n\ntake two parameters: one for the username and one for the user type\nif the username starts with a capital letter and has length between 5 and 10 characters long, it must return \"Username valid\"; otherwise, it must return \"Username invalid\"\nif the user type is an admin or a manager, all usernames must return \"Username valid\"\n\nLoops\nWhen we're writing programs, we often find that we want to repeat a bit of code over and over, or repeat it but change something about it each time. To save ourselves from writing all that code, we can use a loop. JavaScript has two kinds of loops, a while loop and a for loop.\nwhile loop\nPrograms are very efficient when executing recurring tasks, but now imagine you are asked to log numbers from 1 to 100:\nconsole.log(\"The count is 1\");\nconsole.log(\"The count is 2\");\nconsole.log(\"The count is 3\");\nconsole.log(\"The count is 4\");\nconsole.log(\"The count is 5\");\n// ...\nconsole.log(\"The count is 100\");\n\nAlthough this would work you would need to write 100 lines of code to achieve the desired output. A better solution for this problem would require that we could execute a block of code multiple times. This form of control is what we call a loop.\nThere are many ways to create a loop in a program, the first we will study is the while loop:\nwhile ( ) { //... }\nvar count = 1;\nwhile (count \nThe while statement creates a loop. The syntax is somehow similar to the if statement, it evaluates a condition inside the parentheses (true|false) and then it executes the code inside the { } block only if that condition evaluates to true. \nExercise G (10 mins)\nLog the Apollo 11 countdown, use the message provided as the last output.\nIt starts from 8 till 0!\nvar apolloCountdownMessage = \"all engine running... LIFT-OFF!\";\nvar countdown = 8;\n\nconsole.log(apolloCountdownMessage);\n\nExpected output\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nall engine running... LIFT-OFF!\n\nfor loop\nThe for loop is similar to a while loop, but with a more specialized syntax. Programmers invented the for loop when they realized they were always doing the same three things: creating loop counter variables (like i above), incrementing them by some amount, and checking that they're less than a value.\nThe for loop syntax has special places for each of those three things. Here's the same loop as the first while loop above, as a for loop:\nfor (initialization; condition; final-expression) { //... }\n\nfor (let i = 0; i \nThe initialization is let i = 0, the condition is i  and the final-expression is i++. Those blocks can be seen inside the parentheses after the for keyword and separated by semicolons ;, in the following order (initialization; condition; final-expression).\nNotice the line i++ - this is the same as saying i = i + 1 It does exactly the same thing but it is just more convenient to write.\nExercise H (10 mins)\nCalculate the exponential of the even numbers from 5 to 20\nUsing a for loop and the helper functions provided.\nfunction exponential(number) {\n  return number * number;\n}\n\nfunction isEven(number) {\n  return number % 2 === 0;\n}\n\nExpected output\nThe exponential of 6 is 36\nThe exponential of 8 is 64\nThe exponential of 10 is 100\nThe exponential of 12 is 144\nThe exponential of 14 is 196\nThe exponential of 16 is 256\nThe exponential of 18 is 324\n\nArrays\nIf you ever find yourself writing code like this...\nconst mentor1 = \"Daniel\";\nconst mentor2 = \"Irina\";\nconst mentor3 = \"Rares\";\n\n...then it's probably time to use an array!\nArrays are data structures that hold a list of values. We call these values the elements of the array.\nconst mentors = [\"Daniel\", \"Irina\", \"Rares\"];\n\nArrays can hold any type of value (although almost always you only have one data type per array).\nconst testScores = [16, 49, 85];\nconst grades = [\"F\", \"D\", \"A\"];\nconst greetings = [\"Hello, how are you?\", \"Hi! Nice to meet you!\"];\n\nYou can access elements in an array using the index of an element with bracket notation\n&#x1F514; Remember: All arrays start at position 0! To access the first element in an array, you need to access index 0, the second element at 1, the fifth at 4 and so forth. This is called zero-based indexed arrays. There are some very intense reasons for this, but most people just accept it and move on.\nconst students = [\"Ahmed\", \"Maria\", \"Atanas\", \"Nahidul\", \"Jack\"];\n\nstudents[0]; // \"Ahmed\"\nstudents[3]; // \"Nahidul\"\n\nYou can also assign new values to parts of an array:\nconst students = [\"Ahmed\", \"Maria\", \"Atanas\", \"Nahidul\", \"Jack\"];\n\nstudents[2] = \"Bianca\";\n\nconsole.log(students); // [\"Ahmed\", \"Maria\", \"Bianca\", \"Nahidul\", \"Jack\"]\n\nExercise I (5 mins)\nIn the node REPL, enter the following array:\n> const fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'strawberry', 'kiwi', 'fig', 'orange'];\n\nNow, using the correct indexes, get the following values from the array:\n\nstrawberry\nkiwi\norange\nbanana\n\nThen, replace 'apple' with 'raspberry', and replace 'fig' with 'pineapple'.\nExercise J (5 mins)\nComplete this function so that, if the second index in the array contains the name \"Amy\", it returns \"Second index matched!\"\nfunction secondMatchesAmy(array) {\n  if ( ) {\n    return \"Second index matched!\";\n  }\n  return \"Second index not matched\";\n}\n\nUsing for loops with arrays\nWe can use the power of loops to run some code for each element in our array.\nWhen we do this say we iterate over an array.\nconst daysOfWeek = [\n  \"Monday\",\n  \"Tuesday\",\n  \"Wednesday\",\n  \"Thursday\",\n  \"Friday\",\n  \"Saturday\",\n  \"Sunday\",\n];\n\nfor (let i = 0; i \nExercise K (10 mins)\nWrite a function which takes your students array as an input. In the function, use a for loop to iterate over the array and print the name of each student to the console.\nGlossary\n\nDuplicate: exact copies of something (e.g. two or more files, numbers, directory can be exactly the same)\nIndex: numbers that let you know an item's position inside an array\nElement: another name for an item in an array\nIterate: to repeat some code multiple times, as we do when we use a loop\nREPL: (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) an interactive way to execute code you write inside the console\nZero-based Index: an array starting at 0 and not at 1\n\nFor words like Terminal, Primitive Types please see Glossary: JavaScript Core I - 2\nReferences\n\nComparisons in JS (javascript.info)\nLogical operators in JS (javascript.info)\nMore on operators (javascript.info)\nwhile loops (developer.mozilla.org)\nfor loops  (developer.mozilla.org)\nLoops in JS (javascript.info)\nSwitch statements (javascript.info)\nArrays  (developer.mozilla.org)\nWhat are algorithms\nBubble sort\n\nHomework\n\nFrom the Javascript/Core Module 1 repository review and finish all exercises in the folder week-2/InClass\nGo to The Modern JavaScript Tutorial and widen your knowledge on 2.12 Loops: while and for\nComplete all of the exercises in the folder week-2/Homework\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\nComplete the Homework Form, to notify mentors and add comments and questions about the exercises\n\nPractice Day (Saturday)\n\nCheck together, solve doubts and fix the Homework exercises\nGo to CodeWars and solve as many katas as you can:\nReversed Strings\nRemove First and Last Character\nStats: Sum of positive\nFind the smallest integer in the array\nCounting sheep…\nGrasshopper - Summation\nStats: Square(n) Sum\nInvert values\nA Needle in the Haystack\nSum of positive\nSum without highest and lowest number\nCount of positives / sum of negatives\n\n\n[Optional] Complete the exercises in the folder week-2/Extra\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\n\n"},"js-core/week-06/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core/week-06/lesson.html","title":"Week 6 - Arrays and callbacks","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core I - 3\nContents\n\nArray properties\nManipulating arrays\nArray methods\nArray map\nArray forEach\nArray filter\nArray find\n\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this class, you should be able to answer these questions:\n\nDescribe what an array method is and use them to manipulate an array\nWrite code that chains array methods together\nDefine what a callback is\nWrite code that uses a callback to run code\nDefine what an anonymous function is\nWrite code that uses an anonymous function as a callback\n\n\nArray properties\nArrays, like strings, have a length property.\nYou can check this by starting a node console in your terminal.\n$ node\n> let arr = [1, 2, 3];\nundefined\n> arr\n[1, 2, 3]\n> arr.length\n3\n\nManipulating arrays\nYou can get a single value out of an array using bracket notation.\n$ node\n> let ingredients = [\"Flour\", \"Water\", \"Salt\"];\nundefined\n> ingredients[0]\nFlour\n> ingredients[1]\nWater\n> ingredients.length\n3\n\nDid you notice how we use [0] to get the first value?

Don't worry if not! Here's an example to jog your memory:\n$ node\n> let name = \"Daniel\";\nundefined\n> name.toLowerCase()\ndaniel\n\nArrays also have several methods that you can use.\n.sort()\nAn array method that sorts the values in an array into ascending alphabetical or numerical order.\nconst unorderedLetters = [\"z\", \"v\", \"b\", \"f\", \"g\"];\nconst orderedLetters = unorderedLetters.sort();\n\nconst unorderedNumbers = [8, 5, 1, 4, 2];\nconst orderedNumbers = unorderedNumbers.sort();\n\nconsole.log(orderedLetters); // logs [ 'b', 'f', 'g', 'v', 'z' ]\nconsole.log(unorderedLetters); // logs [ 'b', 'f', 'g', 'v', 'z' ]\n\nconsole.log(orderedNumbers); // logs [ 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 ]\nconsole.log(unorderedNumbers); // logs [ 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 ]\n\n\nWhen you call this array method it uses the array on the left side of the dot as an input, and it sorts that array also returning it. Note how both ordered and unordered arrays are sorted now!\n\n.concat()\nAdds (or concatenates) another value or array to the array.\n$ node\n> let arr = [1, 2, 3];\nundefined\n> arr.concat(4)\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n> arr\n[1, 2, 3]\n\nDid you notice how calling the concat method did not change arr? This is because concat, like most array methods, returns a new array, it does not alter the one you called the method on.\nIf you want to use the array returned by calling .concat() you should store it in a new variable.\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\nconst newArr = arr.concat(4);\n\nconsole.log(newArr); // logs [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n.slice()\nReturns a slice of the array.\nYou can tell .slice() where you want the slice to begin and end by passing it two parameters.\n$ node\n> let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nundefined\n> arr.slice(0, 2)\n[0, 1]\n> [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"].slice(1, 2)\n['b']\n\n.includes()\nReturns true if a value is in the array.\nconst mentors = [\"Daniel\", \"Irini\", \"Ashleigh\", \"Rob\", \"Etzali\"];\n\nfunction isAMentor(name) {\n  return mentors.includes(name);\n}\n\nconsole.log(\"Is Rukmuni a mentor?\");\nconsole.log(isAMentor(\"Rukmini\")); // logs false\n\n.join()\nReturns all the array values joined together in a string. By default, this method takes no parameters and then the elements are divided with a comma ,. If you provide it with a string parameter though, then it becomes the divider of the elements, like the example below:\n$ node\n> [\"H\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"].join();\n'H,e,l,l,o'\n> [\"H\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"].join(\"--\");\n'H--e--l--l--o'\n\nThere is a string method .split(). In an interactive console try using the string .split() method and the array .join(). How could they work together?\nExercise B (10 minutes)\n\nUse the array of the people from your class\nCombine it with another array filled with the names from another class\nconsole.log the names in alphabetical order\nCreate a function that takes a name and an array of names and returns a string. If the name is not in an array, it should return  is not at the class with . If the name is in the array, it should return  is at the class with .\n\nArray map\nImagine you have an array of names...\nconst mentors = [\"Daniel \", \"irina \", \" Gordon\", \"ashleigh \"];\n\nYou notice that the names are not formatted consistently. To fix the array you decide you need to trim whitespace and convert to lowercase. How do you do that for every value in the array?\nWe can write a function that changes one name:\nfunction tidy(name) {\n  return name.trim().toLowerCase();\n}\n\nAll you need to run every name in the array through this function and update the array values. Thankfully there is an array method that does just this!\n.map()\nRuns every item in the array through a function and returns a new array with the values returned by the function.\nHave a look at this other example:\nfunction double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n}\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map(double);\n\nThe map() method runs the function we provided (double) on each item in the array and uses the return values to create a new array. In the example numbersDoubled is a new array containing [2, 4, 6].\nCallback functions\nA function that we provide to a method is commonly called a callback function. The term highlights that although we provide the double function, the .map() method calls it. (Notice how we never write double() to call the function).\nWe'll see callback functions used a lot more in the coming weeks.\nOften, when a function is only needed for a map operation, developers will declare the callback function inside of the method call. Let's try copying and pasting the function declaration inside of the .map() method call.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map(function double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n});\n\nWe can make this shorter by removing the function name to declare an anonymous function. We can do this because we are not using the function anywhere else in the code, so we do not need the function name to reference it.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map(function (number) {\n  return number * 2;\n});\n\nWe can make this code even shorter still. In the latest versions of JavaScript a way of declaring functions was introduced called arrow functions.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map((number) => {\n  return number * 2;\n});\n\nThe arrow function syntax lets you declare a function without the function keyword. (There are some other subtle differences between arrow functions and regular functions that you will learn about at a much later stage).\nThere is one last thing you can do to make your code shorter. If you remove the braces ({}) from an arrow function, the body of the function will be returned without needing to write the return keyword.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);\n\nIn the example above, the expression number * 2 is automatically returned because it comes directly after the => arrow (instead of coming after curly braces). This is called an implicit return.\nExercise C (10 minutes)\nI have a function defined below as:\nfunction abracaFunction(yourFunc) {\n  console.log(\n    \"I am abracaFunction! Watch as I mutate an array of strings to your heart's content!\"\n  );\n  const abracaArray = [\n    \"James\",\n    \"Elamin\",\n    \"Ismael\",\n    \"Sanyia\",\n    \"Chris\",\n    \"Antigoni\",\n  ];\n\n  const abracaOutput = yourFunc(abracaArray);\n\n  return abracaOutput;\n}\n\nThis function does not need to be modified. Can you pass in a callback function which will mutate abracaArray such that it:\n\nUpper cases all letters in the array\n\nExercise D\nModify your callback function from the previous exercise so that it also:\n\nSorts abracaArray in alphabetical order\n\nArray forEach\nThe .forEach() method is similar to .map() except it does not return a new array. Therefore .forEach() is only useful if you want to perform side effects.\nSide effects\nGenerally, functions should take an input and return an output (based on that input), and not do anything else.\nWhen functions meet this criteria they can be called pure functions.\nA pure function does not:\n\naccess any data unless it was passed in as a parameter\nchange data declared outside the function\ninteracts with anything outside of the function (e.g. logs a message to the console, shows a message on a website, saves data to disk)\n\nThese are all example of side effects. Of course, from time to time, we will need to perform side effects, but we should try to avoid side effects inside of functions and only have them when absolutely necessary.\n.forEach()\nSay we want to log to the console a list of names.\nconst names = [\"Daniel\", \"mozafar\", \"irina\"];\n\nWe can use .forEach() to go through the array, item by item, and call a function we provide.\nnames.forEach(function (name, index) {\n  console.log(index + \": \" + name);\n});\n\nExercise E (10 minutes)\n\nCreate a function that takes a birthYear, and returns the age of someone\nYou are given an array with year that 7 people were born, [1964, 2008, 1999, 2005, 1978, 1985, 1919]. Take this array and create another array containing their ages.\nconsole.log the birth years array\n\nExercise F (5 minutes)\nYou can drive in the UK at the age of 17.\n\nWrite another function that takes a birth year and returns a string Born in {year} can drive or Born in {year} can drive in {x} years\nUse the array of birth years, [ 1964, 2008, 1999, 2005, 1978, 1985, 1919 ], to get an array of strings saying if these people can drive\nconsole.log the answers\n\nArray filter\nImagine you have an array of students' test scores:\nconst testScores = [90, 50, 100, 66, 25, 80, 81];\n\nYou want to show only the test scores that are higher than 80. How do you do that for every value in the array?\nWe can write a function that checks if one score is greater than 80:\nfunction isHighScore(score) {\n  return score > 80;\n}\n\nTo find out which scores were greater than 80, you'd have to run this function against every score in the array, and push the 80+ scores into a new array. Thankfully there is an array method that does just this!\n.filter()\nRuns every item in the array through a condition that we set, and returns a new array with the values that match the condition.\nconst highTestScores = testScores.filter(isHighScore);\n\nconsole.log(highTestScores); // logs [90, 100, 81]\n\nExercise G (10 mins)\nCreate a function which:\n\nTakes an array of birthYears\nUses console.log to print the message These are the birth years of people who can drive: \nReturns an array of people who can drive (remember, you can drive if you are 17 years or older)\n\nArray find\nImagine you have an array of names:\nconst names = [\"Daniel\", \"James\", \"Irina\", \"Mozafar\", \"Ashleigh\"];\n\nHow would you find the first name that's longer than 6 characters?\nYou can write a predicate function that checks if a string is longer than 6 characters:\nfunction isLongName(name) {\n  return name.length > 6;\n}\n\nTo find the first item that satisfies the predicate you would have to go through each array item, and pass it into isLongName. Once it returns true, we can stop going through the array and grab the item that passed the predicate's test. Sounds complicated! Thankfully there is an array method that does just this!\n.find()\nSearches through the array and returns the value of the first item that satisfies a predicate function.\nconst longName = names.find(isLongName);\n\nconsole.log(longName); // logs Mozafar\n\nExercise H (10 mins)\nCreate a function which:\n\nTakes an array of names\nLooks to see if your name is in the array\nIf it is, return Found me!; if not, return Haven't found me :(\n\nChaining\nNotice how we were able to write one method after another e.g. names.map(formatName).forEach(log)? This is called method chaining.\nYou can call .forEach() after .map() because .map() returns a new array.\nConsider this code:\nfunction formatName(name) {\n  return name.split(\"\")[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);\n}\n\nfunction log(name, index) {\n  console.log(index + \": \" + name);\n}\n\nconst namesFormatted = names.map(formatName);\nnamesFormatted.forEach(log);\n\nIt can be written more simply (without assigning the array returned from .map() to a variable):\nnames.map(formatName).forEach(log);\n\nBe careful though! You can not call .map() after .forEach.\nnames.forEach(log).map(formatName); // ERROR\n\nThis code does not work because forEach() does not return a new array (it returns undefined). The code is therefore attempting to call .map() on undefined, and undefined does not have a .map() method.\nExercise I (15 minutes)\nCreate a function which accepts an array of \"messy\" strings. Example:\n[\n  100,\n  \"iSMael\",\n  55,\n  45,\n  \"sANyiA\",\n  66,\n  \"JaMEs\",\n  \"eLAmIn\",\n  23,\n  \"IsMael\",\n  67,\n  19,\n  \"ElaMIN\",\n];\n\nThis function should:\n\nRemove all non-string entries\nChange the strings to upper case, and add an exclamation mark to the end\n\nIf you're using the above example, you should expect to return an array with 2x ELAMIN!, 1x SANYIA!, 2x ISMAEL! and 1x JAMES!.\nHomework\n\nFrom the Javascript/Core Module 1 repository review and finish all exercises in the folder week-3/InClass\nComplete all of the exercises in the folder week-3/Homework\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\nComplete the Homework Form, to notify mentors and add comments and questions about the exercises\nGo to The Modern JavaScript Tutorial and widen your knowledge on:\n2.13 Switch\n5.5 Array methods\n\n\n\nPractice Day (Saturday)\n\nCheck together, solve doubts and fix the Homework exercises\nGo to CodeWars and solve all the katas you didn't finish last week\n[Optional] Complete the exercises in the folder week-3/Extra\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\n\n"},"js-core-2/":{"url":"js-core-2/","title":"JavaScript II","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core 2\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\n\n\n\n\nweek-07\nObjects\n\n\nweek-08\nJS in the Browser (DOM, and AJAX)\n\n\nweek-09\nMore JS in the Browser\n\n\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-07/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-07/lesson.html","title":"Week 7 - Objects","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core II - 1\nBefore the class\n\nFork the Javascript/Core Module 2 repository to your personal account and clone it.

You see objects. In programming, objects are nothing more than representations of things. \nIn this class you will learn how to manage objects, and arrays of objects.\nBy the end of this lesson students should be able to:\n\nDefine what an object is in JavaScript\nBe able to write code that can use an object to store data\nBe able to write code that changes the properties of an object\nBe able to write code that can retrieve data from an object\nWrite and call methods inside JavaScript objects\nUse Objects when contained inside an array\nWrite code that uses objects built-in methods\nWrite code that can iterate through an object\n\nObjects\nObjects in the real world have properties that describe how they are unique. Your laptop, for example, has a brand (Lenovo/Apple etc.), a screen size (13/15 inch), RAM (8/16GB) etc.\nHow would we describe the above laptop as a JavaScript object?\nlet laptop = {\n  brand: \"Lenovo\",\n  screenSize: 13,\n  isTouchscreen: true,\n};\n\nExercise A-1 (5 min)\nDescribe your own laptop as a JavaScript object. Try to think of as many properties as you can!\nExample:\nlet laptop = {\n  brand: \"Lenovo\",\n  screenSize: 13,\n  isTouchscreen: true,\n};\n\nExercise A-2 (5 min)\nThink of 5 different real world \"things\" that you can describe with a JavaScript object\nAssign each of them to a separate variable\nExample:\nlet car = {\n    brand: \"Seat\",\n    model: \"Arona\",\n    color: \"white\",\n    horsepower: 115,\n    doors: 5\n};\n\nExercise A-3 (5 min)\n/*\nThe objects below have some syntax issues - try and fix them all!\n*/\n\nlet kitten = {\n    fur colour: \"orange\",\n    age \"23\"\n};\n\nlet laptop =\n    brand: \"Lenovo\"\n    ram \"5GB\"\n}\n\nlet phone = {\n    operating system \"iOS\",\n    hasStylus: true,\n    megapixels 12\n    \"batteryLife\": \"24 hours\"\n\nUseful words to remember when talking about objects:\n\nobject literal: anything that has a set of {...} around a set of properties is an object literal\nproperty or key: brand, screenSize and isTouchScreen are properties/keys of the object\nvalues: \"Lenovo\", 13 and true are values of the object's properties\n\nObjects Get and Set\nGetting the value of an object's property\nLet's take one of the objects we looked at earlier..\nlet laptop = {\n  brand: \"Lenovo\",\n  screenSize: 13,\n  isTouchscreen: true,\n};\n\n\nTry to console.log(laptop). The output might depend on your environment!\n\nTo find out the value of an object's property, you can use the dot notation..\nconsole.log(laptop.brand);\n\nYou can also use the bracket notation (although this is rarely used, it's good to know):\nconsole.log(laptop[\"brand\"]);\n\nExercise B-1 (5 min)\nConsole.log the values of each property of \"kitten\"\n/*\nConsole.log the values of each property of \"kitten\"\n*/\n\nlet kitten = {\n  ageMonths: 3,\n  isFemale: true,\n  furColour: \"brown\",\n};\n\nExercise B-2 (5 min)\n/*\nThe following code contains syntax errors - try and fix them!\nOnce you fix them, run the code, it should output the correct values!\n*/\n\nlet phone = {\n    brand:'iPhone,\n    model 'iPhone X'\n    launchYear: 2017,\n    is Unlocked: true\n;\n\nlet phoneBrand = phone.bbrand;\nlet phoneLaunchYear = phone[launchYear];\n\nconsole.log(phoneBrand);\nconsole.log(phoneLaunchYear);\n\n// -> it should output:\n// iPhone\n// 2017\n\nSetting the value of a property\nSimilar to reading, if we want to set a property:\nlaptop.brand = \"Apple\";\n\nIt's strongly recommended you always use the same type when re-assigning an object's property (if it was a string before, keep it a string - and so on).\nlet laptop = {\n  brand: \"Lenovo\",\n  screenSize: 13,\n  isTouchscreen: true,\n};\n\n// DON'T DO THIS\nlaptop.screenSize = \"15 inch\";\n\n// OK TO DO\nlaptop.screenSize = 15;\n\nExercise B-3 (5 min)\n/*\nWrite code in the space provided so that it outputs \"Gilbert\"\n*/\n\n// WRITE CODE BELOW THIS\n\n// WRITE CODE ABOVE THIS\n\nconsole.log(kitten.name);\n// -> it should output: \"Gilbert\"\n\nExercise B-4 (5 min)\n/*\nWrite code in the space provided so that the expected values output\n*/\n\nlet dog = {\n  name: \"Billy\",\n  wantsToPlay: false,\n};\n\n// WRITE CODE BELOW THIS LINE\n\n// WRITE CODE ABOVE THIS LINE\n\nconsole.log(dog.name);\nconsole.log(dog.wantsToPlay);\n\n// -> it should output:\n// Rex\n// true\n\nMore Complex Objects\nObject properties can even be assigned other objects, arrays or variables too. The example below shows an object with keys that have been assigned a variable, an array, and an object.\nlet kittenName = \"Feathers\";\n\nlet kitten = {\n  name: kittenName,\n  toyCollection: [\"blue ball\", \"green ball\", \"hoover box\"],\n  favoriteLocation: {\n    roomName: \"Living room\",\n    napPlace: \"window\",\n    idealTemperatureCelsius: 24,\n  },\n};\n\nExercise C-1 (5 min)\n/*\nGiven the following house - follow the instructions below.\n\nMake sure you run the file after and it outputs the correct results.\n*/\n\nlet house = {\n  address: \"1 Kinning Park\",\n  previousOwners: [\"Claire M.\", \"John A.\"],\n  currentOwner: {\n    firstName: \"Margaret\",\n    lastName: \"Conway\",\n  },\n};\n\n/*\n  DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE\n\n  WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW\n*/\n\n// - change the address of \"house\" to '51 Berkley Road'\n// - change the previous owners of \"house\" to [\"Brian M.\", \"Fiona S.\"]\n// - change the last name of the current owner of \"house\" to \"Montgomery\"\n\n/*\n  DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE\n*/\n\nconsole.log(\n  `Expected result: 51 Berkley Road.

Actual result: ${house.previousOwners.toString()}`\n);\nconsole.log(`Expected result: false. Actual result: ${house.isForSale}`);\n\nObject Methods\nBesides having specific properties, objects in the real world can also do things. For example, a computer can display something on the screen, a person can say their names etc... In Javascript, we do this using 'methods'. A method is a function attached to a particular object. You have already used some predefined methods before, for example toUpperCase() on a string or filter() on an array.\nlet athlete = {\n  name: \"Usain Bolt\",\n  goldMedals: 25,\n  sayHi: function () {\n    return \"Hi everybody!\";\n  },\n};\n\nHow do we call this method?\nathlete.sayHi(); // returns \"Hi everybody!\"\n\nAn object method can also rely on the other properties of the object to do more complex calculation. To reference the current object in the body of the method, we will use the keyword this. Let's take an example.\nlet athlete = {\n  name: \"Usain Bolt\",\n  goldMedals: 25,\n  sayName: function () {\n    return \"My name is \" + this.name;\n  },\n};\n\nathlete.sayName(); // returns \"My name is Usain Bolt\"\n\nKnowing this, you can have methods which modify existing properties of your object.\nlet athlete = {\n  name: \"Usain Bolt\",\n  goldMedals: 25,\n  winNewMedal: function () {\n    this.goldMedals = this.goldMedals + 1;\n  },\n};\n\nathlete.winNewMedal();\nconsole.log(athelete.goldMedals); // prints \"26\"\n\nAs methods are just functions attached to objects, they can also take parameters.\nlet athlete = {\n  name: \"Usain Bolt\",\n  goldMedals: 25,\n  silverMedals: 7,\n  winNewMedal: function (medal) {\n    if (medal === \"gold\") {\n      this.goldMedals = this.goldMedals + 1;\n    } else {\n      this.silverMedals = this.silverMedals + 1;\n    }\n  },\n};\n\nathlete.winNewMedal(\"silver\");\nconsole.log(athlete.goldMedals); // prints \"25\"\nconsole.log(athlete.silverMedals); // prints \"8\"\n\nExercise D-1 (5 min)\n/*\n\nA person named Alice is defined below.\n  1. Add a method \"greet\" so this person can say hello.\n  2. Add a method \"sayName\" so this person can say their own name. Hint: use 'this' keyword to access the name property.\n\n*/\n\nlet person = {\n  name: \"Alice\",\n  age: 25,\n};\n\n/*\nDO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE\n*/\n\nconsole.log(\n  `Expected result: Hello everybody.

Actual result: ${person.currentAddress}`);\n\nperson.celebrateBirthday();\nconsole.log(`Expected result: 26. Actual result: ${person.age}`);\n\nArrays of objects\nIn the past weeks, you've learned about using arrays of numbers, arrays of string etc... In the following, we will learn how to use arrays of objects.\nlet kitten1 = {\n  name: \"Fluffy\",\n  weeksOld: 2,\n};\n\nlet kitten2 = {\n  name: \"Megatron\",\n  weeksOld: 1,\n};\n\nlet kitten3 = {\n  name: \"Billy\",\n  weeksOld: 5,\n};\n\nlet kittens = [kitten1, kitten2, kitten3];\n\nYou can also use all the functions for arrays that you learned before: find, some, every, filter, map, forEach... As an example, we want to filter all the kittens who are less than 3 weeks old:\nfunction isYoungerThan3Weeks(kitten) {\n  return kitten.weeksOld \nWhat if we want to get an array of all the kitties names?\nfunction getName(kitten) {\n  return kitten.name;\n}\n\nkittens.map(getName); // returns [\"Fluffy\", \"Megatron\", \"Billy\"]\n\nExercise E-1 (5 min)\n/*\n1) Define an array containing the 3 persons defined below.\n2) Return an array of the person names (hint: use map).\n3) Filter the persons to return an array with the person younger than 28 years old (hint: use filter).\n*/\n\nlet person1 = {\n    name: \"Alice\",\n    age: 25\n};\n\nlet person2 = {\n    name: \"Bob\",\n    age: 30\n};\n\nlet person3 = {\n    name: \"John\",\n    age: 20\n};\n\n/*\nDO NOT EDIT ANYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE\nWRITE YOUR CODE BELOW\n*/\n\n\nlet persons = // Complete here\n\nlet personNames = // Complete here\n\nlet personsYoungerThan28YearsOld = // Complete here\n\n\n/*\nDO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE\n*/\n\nconsole.log(\"Question 1: array defined with 3 persons -> \",\n    (persons[0] === person1 && persons[1] === person2 && persons[2] === person3) ?

Someone else created these methods, and we can use them in our code.\nLike arrays, objects have built-in methods that can help us. In this lesson, we will learn about Object.keys() and Object.values().\nObject.keys()\nThis method goes into our object, and returns the object property names as an array.\nHere is an example output for using .keys():\nlet car = {\n  brand: \"Seat\",\n  model: \"Arona\",\n  color: \"White\",\n};\n\nconsole.log(Object.keys(car));\n// prints [ 'brand', 'model', 'color' ]\n\nObject.values()\nThis method goes into our object, and returns the values of every property as an array.\nHere is an example output for using .values():\nlet car = {\n  brand: \"Seat\",\n  model: \"Arona\",\n  color: \"White\",\n};\n\nconsole.log(Object.values(car));\n// prints [ 'Seat', 'Arona', 'White' ]\n\nExercise F-1 (5 min)\n/*\n\nReturn the keys and values of the following object\n\n*/\n\nlet capitalCities = {\n  scotland: 'Edinburgh',\n  kenya: 'Nairobi',\n  australia: 'Canberra',\n  canada: 'Ottawa'\n};\n\nlet highScores = {\n  55: 'Alistair',\n  100: 'David',\n  89: 'Hannah',\n  34: ['Sergi', 'Frank',]\n};\n\n// ONLY EDIT BELOW HERE\n\nlet capitalCitiesKeys = ;\nlet highScoresKeys = ;\nlet capitalCitiesValues = ;\nlet highScoresValues = ;\n\n// ONLY EDIT ABOVE HERE\n\nconsole.log(capitalCitiesKeys);\n// prints [ 'scotland', 'kenya', 'australia', 'canada' ]\n\nconsole.log(highScoresKeys)\n// prints ['34, '55', '89', '100']\n\nconsole.log(capitalCitiesValues);\n// prints [ 'Edinburgh', 'Nairobi', 'Canberra', 'Ottawa' ]\n\nconsole.log(highScoresValues)\n// prints [[ 'Sergi', 'Frank' ], 'Alistair, 'David', 'Hannah']\n\nLoop through an Object\nOnce in a while it will be required to loop through objects. You can achieve this in various ways.\nUse for...in statement\nThe for...in statement iterates over all distinct properties of an object.\nExample:\nconst flowers = {\n  tulip: 20,\n  rose: 10,\n  lily: 15,\n};\n\nfor (const key in flowers) {\n  console.log(`${key}: ${flowers[key]}`);\n}\n\n// Prints\n// tulip: 20\n// rose: 10\n// lily: 15\n\nConvert object into an array and loop through the array\nSince we started JavaScript, we have used console.log to print things to our console.\nOnce you create an array of the object's keys or values using the Object.keys, Object.values methods, you can loop through it as if it was a normal array using array methods like forEach.\nExample:\nconst flowers = {\n  tulip: 20,\n  rose: 10,\n  lily: 15,\n};\n\n// Looping through the array created from Object.keys\nconst flowerKeys = Object.keys(flowers);\n\nflowerKeys.forEach((key) => {\n  console.log(`${key}: ${flowers[key]}`);\n});\n\n// Prints\n// tulip: 20\n// rose: 10\n// lily: 15\n\nExercise G-1 (5 min)\n// You are given an object of student names and grades\n// Loop through all the students' grades and console log the name and grade of the ones with grade more than 18\n// Try to use both methods shown above to achieve this\n\nconst studentGrades = {\n  tom: 20,\n  george: 17,\n  abdul: 19,\n};\n\n// Prints\n// TOM - 20\n// ABDUL - 19\n\nHomework\n\nFrom the Javascript/Core Module 2 repository review and finish all exercises in the folder week-1/InClass\nComplete all of the exercises in the folder week-1/Homework\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\nComplete the Homework Form, to notify mentors and add comments and questions about the exercises\n\nPractice Day (Saturday)\n\nCheck together, solve doubts and fix the Homework exercises\n[Optional] Complete the exercises in the folder week-1/Extra\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html","title":"Week 8 - JS in the Browser","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core II - 2\nBefore the class\n\n\nOpen in Visual Studio the repo the repository you forked last week\nGo to the folder week-2/InClass/A-myfirstscript\nExecute your first Website with javascript by using vscode-live-server\nInstall the plugin by: In VSCode type ctrl+P, then type ext install ritwickdey.liveserver.\nRight click on index.html and select \"Open with Live Server\"\nor just open the index.html on your browser and refresh every time you change your code\n\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\nAfter long days working on a black screen, with the only output of console.log...But JavaScript was not meant to be run in console.log: it was meant to make web pages dynamic.\nLots of websites are powered by JavaScript today, and some (like Facebook) cannot function at all without it: it's become that important to the look and feel of the website.\nToday we will learn how to combine all this javascript knowledge with HTML and CSS in a browser, changing elements dynamically from user actions.\nBy the end of this lesson students should be able to:\n\nDefine what the DOM is and what it does\nUse query selectors to retrieve elements from the DOM\nUse event listeners to respond to events that happen on the DOM\nCreate DOM elements using JavaScript and add them to the DOM\nManipulate DOM elements using JavaScript to change their properties\n\nContent\n\nThe DOM\nAccess DOM elements\nAttach events to DOM elements\nCreate DOM elements\nManipulate DOM elements\n\nThe DOM\nYour webpages are made up of a bunch of HTML elements, nested within each other (parents and children). But JavaScript doesn't know about any of that.\nThankfully, in JavaScript we have access to this \"DOM\" object (Document Object Model) which is actually a representation of our webpage that JavaScript can work with.\nHere are two examples, HTML and then JavaScript, of how the DOM might look like:\n\n  \n    Welcome!\n    Hello world!\n  \n\n\nlet document = {\n  body: {\n    h1: \"Welcome\",\n    p: \"Hello world!\",\n  },\n};\n\nThis is how we would represent the document hierarchy above as a tree of nodes:\n\nBut how can we combine HTML and Javascript? The  tag allows us to include a piece of JavaScript in a HTML document.\nTesting alert\nalert(\"hello!\");\n\nSuch a script will run as soon as its  tag is encountered while the browser reads the HTML. This page will pop up a dialog when opened—the alert function resembles prompt, in that it pops up a little window, only shows a message.\nIncluding large programs directly in HTML documents is often impractical. The  tag can be given an src attribute to fetch a script file (a text file containing a JavaScript program) from a URL.\nTesting alert\n\n\nThe myfirstscript.js file includes a line with the alert(\"hello!\");, and the result is exactly the same.\nExercise A-1 (5 min)\n\nLook the files index.html and myfirstscript.js in the folder week-2/InClass/A-myfirstscript\nExecute the Visual Studio Live Server as explained at the beginning of this lesson\nSee how the alert appears \nRight a name in the input and click the button, right know you don't have to understand the code, but, what do you think the code is doing?\n\nAccess DOM elements\nThe DOM offers a lot of useful functions we can use to find elements on the page. Here are some we'll be using today:\ndocument.querySelector(\"#mainHeader\");\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"p\");\n\nBoth .querySelector and querySelectorAll accept a CSS selector as an input.\n.querySelector selects only the first element it finds, querySelectorAll selects all elements (it returns a NodeList, which you can think of as being similar to an array; it is an ordered sequence of DOM elements which you can loop through like with an array. The difference is that many common array methods like .map or .concat can't be used on a NodeList. To turn a NodeList into an array, you can use Array.from, e.g. let elementArray = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\"div\"));).\nExercise B-1 (10 min)\n\nGo to the folder week-2/InClass/B-dom-manipulation\nComplete the Task 1 explained in the file exercise.js\n\nAttach events to DOM elements\nOnce you retrieve an element using .querySelector, you can attach an event to it. An event is any action that can be performed on that element. For now, we will just use the click event:\nlet myButton = document.querySelector(\"#myButton\");\nmyButton.addEventListener(\"click\", alertSomething);\n\nfunction alertSomething() {\n  alert(\"Something\");\n}\n\nYou will notice in the example that we passed a second argument to addEventListener. That second argument is the function that we want to invoke when that event has happened.\nExercise B-2 (10 min)\n\nGo to the folder week-2/InClass/B-dom-manipulation\nComplete the Task 2 explained in the file exercise.js\n\nThe elements returned by document.querySelector have the same properties as a normal HTML element: for example, you can get access to their css styles.\nlet myElement = document.querySelector(\"#myElement\");\nmyElement.style.backgroundColor = \"red\";\n\nExercise B-3 (10 min)\n\nGo to the folder week-2/InClass/B-dom-manipulation\nComplete the Task 3 explained in the file exercise.js\n\nCreate DOM elements\nUsing the document, you can also create new elements. These elements will not appear until you append them as a child of another element though:\nlet paragraph = document.createElement(\"p\"); // here we're just creating it, element is not visible yet\nmyElement.appendChild(paragraph); // now the element is added to our view, but it's empty\n\ndocument.createElement accepts as an input any element type. So for example document.createElement(\"article\") will create a new article element.\nExercise B-4 (10 min)\n\nGo to the folder week-2/InClass/B-dom-manipulation\nComplete the Task 4 explained in the file exercise.js\n\nManipulate DOM elements\nYou can then change the text displayed inside elements using the innerText property:\nparagraph.innerText = \"How are you?\"; // now we can see the text displaying on the screen\n\nWe've been using document.querySelector to retrieve a single element.\nTo retrieve a list of multiple elements (that match a specific class name for example, or a specific tag) we use document.querySelectorAll.\n//change the background of all the paragraph items on our page\nlet paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll(\"p\");\nfor (let i = 0; i \nWe've learned that style and innerText are properties of DOM elements. Image tags can also have width and height.\nWhile it's really easy to change styles directly on elements using the style property, it is not usually a good idea to mix JavaScript and CSS (see separation of concerns in the first lesson). To solve this, we can use the className property to set the class for an element instead of changing its styles directly:\n//before: \nlet container = document.querySelector(\"#myContainer\");\ncontainer.className = \"largeBlock\";\n//after: \n\nTo get the text from an Input field:\nlet updateTitleBtn = document.querySelector(\"#updateTitleBtn\");\n\nupdateTitleBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n  let inputBox = document.querySelector(\"#titleInput\");\n  let title = inputBox.value;\n\n  let titleElement = document.querySelector(\"#lessonTitle\");\n  titleElement.innerText = title;\n  inputBox.value = title;\n});\n\nThe above waits for click on a button. When the button is clicked, it gets the input box element (inputBox variable).\nTo get the entered text from it, we use the value property: let title = inputBox.value.\nExercise B-5 (10 min)\n\nGo to the folder week-2/InClass/B-dom-manipulation\nComplete the Task 5 explained in the file exercise.js\n\nExercise B-6 (10 min)\n\nGo to the folder week-2/InClass/B-dom-manipulation\nComplete the Task 6 explained in the file exercise.js\n\nExercise B-7 (10 min)\n\nGo to the folder week-2/InClass/B-dom-manipulation\nComplete the Task 7 explained in the file exercise.js\n\nHomework\n\nFrom the Javascript/Core Module 2 repository review and finish all exercises in the folder week-2/InClass\nComplete all of the exercises in the folder week-2/Homework/1-exercises\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\nComplete the Homework Form, to notify mentors and add comments and questions about the exercises\n\nPractice Day (Saturday)\n\nCheck together, solve doubts and fix the Homework exercises\nComplete the exercises in the folder week-2/Homework\n[Optional] Complete the exercises in the folder week-2/Extra\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-09/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-09/lesson.html","title":"Week 9 - More JS in the Browser ","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core II - 3\nLearning objectives\nIn this lesson you will learn about Synchronous and Asynchronous programming and what is a callback, complex concepts that write code is needed to understand them.\nAlso, you will understand the architecture client/server, what HTTP works and how to use fetch.\nBy the end of this lesson students should be able to:\n\nDefine the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code\nDescribe why writing asynchronous code is important when working with the internet\nWrite code that is able to pass a function to another function as a parameter and run it\nUse callbacks to run code at some point in the future\nDefine a client's and server's role in the client/server architecture\nDescribe the difference between a GET and POST request\nExplain how resources are loaded on the internet using GET and POST\nList the steps that a browser does when loading a website from the internet\n\nContents\n\nSynchronous and Asynchronous programming\nA real life example\nA Javascript example\nCallbacks\n\n\nHow does the web work?\nClient/Server architecture\nHTTP Requests\nFetch\n\n\n\n\nSynchronous and Asynchronous programming\nIn a synchronous programming model, tasks run one at a time. When a long running action starts, the program waits for it to finish and return the result before it moves to the next action.\nAsynchronous programming allows multiple actions to happen at the same time. When a long running action starts, the program can continue to run. When the action finishes the program will get notified and get access to the result returned.\n\nA real life example\nAn example of this in real life, are phone calls and text messages.\n\nPhone calls are synchronous because you can't (really) do anything while the\nother person is speaking. You are always waiting for your turn to respond\nText messages are asynchronous. When you send a text, you can go away and do\nsomething else, until the other person responds.\n\nJavascript examples\nCan you analyze in what order these messages will be printed?\n//synchronous\nconsole.log(\"First action\");\nconsole.log(\"Second action\");\nconsole.log(\"Third action\");\n\n//asynchronous\nconsole.log(\"First action\");\nsetTimeout(function () {\n  console.log(\"Second action\");\n}, 1000);\nconsole.log(\"Third action\");\n\nAnd now?\n//functions\nfunction first(){\n  console.log(\"First action\");\n  setTimeout(firstWithTimeout, 2000);\n}\nfunction firstWithTimeout(){\n  console.log(\"First action with timeout\");\n}\n\nfunction second(){\n  console.log(\"Second action\");\n  setTimeout(secondWithTimeout, 1000);\n}\n\nfunction secondWithTimeout(){\n  console.log(\"Second action with timeout\");\n}\n\nfunction third(){\n  console.log(\"Third action\");\n}\n\n//main\nfirst();\nsecond();\nthird();\n\nAs you can observe, functions in Javascript are asynchronous, the main code continues without waiting the function is finished.\nIn some other programming languages, functions by default are synchronous.\nExercise A (15 min)\nIn folder InClass/A-timeout do exercise.js\nCallbacks\nWe have already seen callback functions - in the Array methods forEach, map, filter etc. They are functions that are passed as parameter to another function.\nIn order to achieve asynchronicity, callbacks can be passed on functions that perform a slow action. By doing so, the callback function can be called with the result.\nThis allows you to run some other code while you're waiting for something to finish.\nfunction finished() {\n  console.log(\"The task has finished\");\n}\n\nfunction thingThatTakesALongTime(callbackFunction) {\n  //... Task that takes a long time to complete\n\n  callbackFunction(); // This is where the 'console.log' happens\n}\n\n// Pass the function to 'thingThatTakesALongTime' just like a normal variable\nthingThatTakesALongTime(finished);\n\nA simple example of an asynchronous function is setTimeout. This allows you to run a function after a given time period. The first argument is the function you want to run, the second argument is the delay (in milliseconds)\n// Separate function definition\nfunction myCallbackFunction() {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!\");\n}\nsetTimeout(myCallbackFunction, 1000);\n\n// Inline function\nsetTimeout(function () {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!\");\n}, 500);\n\nNow let's use a timeout and a callback function together:\nfunction mainFunction(callback) {\n  console.log(\"Starting!\");\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    callback();\n  }, 1000);\n  console.log(\"Continuing!\");\n}\nfunction myCallbackFunction() {\n  console.log(\"Finished!\");\n}\nmainFunction(myCallbackFunction);\n\nExercise B (15 min)\nIn folder InClass/B-movies do exercise.js\nHow does the web work?\nClient/Server architecture\n\nA Client is the typical web user's internet-connected devices and apps. This can be a web browser, a Slack app, your phone, etc.\nA Server is a computer or program that manages access to resources such as webpages, sites, or apps.\nThere are database servers, mail servers, game servers, etc. The vast majority of these servers are accessed over the internet. They can take the form of industrial server farms that provide a service to millions of users (used by Facebook, Google, etc.), to personal servers for storing your files.\nThe server communicates with clients.\nClient–server systems use the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.\n\nHTTP Requests\nA server stores the data, and the client (other programs or computers) requests data or sends some of its own. But how do they talk to each other?\nFor the client and the server to communicate they need an established language (a protocol). Which is what HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is for. It defines the methods you can use to communicate with a server and indicate your desired actions on the resources of the server.\nThere are two main types of requests: GET and POST.\n\n\n\nRequest type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGET\nAsk for a specified resource (e.g. show me that photo)\n\n\nPOST\nSend content to the server (e.g. post a photo)\n\n\n\nHTTP is the language of the internet. In our case we're using Javascript, but you can send HTTP requests with other laguages as well.\nThe Network Tab\nThe network tab is a useful tool that helps us understand how content is loaded on a website.\nYou can view it by Right Click > Inspect > Network.\nTake some time to look at the network tab when we open this lesson.\nThe important parts of the the Network Tab are:\n\nNetwork Log\nTimeline View\nResource Details\n\nExercise C-1 (10 min)\n\nLet's take a look at GET requests in the Browser.\nLook at this repository here:\n\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Network-Tab-Example\n\nIn your groups, you should try to work out what you expect to see in the Network tab when we look at it. You should create a list of the requests that will be made in this format.\nYou are not allowed to open the website in a browser\ne.g.\n\nGET index.html\nGET format.de\nGET otherfile.se\n...\n\nWhen you have completed the list you should share it on Slack\nYou can see the website online here\n\nhttps://codeyourfuture.github.io/Network-Tab-Example/\n\n\nExercise C-2 (10 min)\n\nLet's take a look at POST requests in the Browser.\nYou can see the website online here\n\nhttps://codeyourfuture.github.io/Network-Tab-Example/\n\nAt the bottom of the page you will see a series of buttons. When you click a button on the website it will send a POST request to a server.\n\nUsing only the Network tab work out which button is sending a post request.\nWhat is in the body of the post request?\n\n\nFetch\nThe interface through which browser JavaScript can make HTTP requests is called fetch. By default, fetch uses GET method.\nCalling fetch returns a promise that resolves to a Response object holding information about the server’s response, such as its status code and its headers.\nThe first argument to fetch is the URL that should be requested. When that URL doesn’t start with a protocol name (such as http:). When it starts with a slash (/), it replaces the current path, which is the part after the server name.\nThe following code go to an API endpoint and get an object with weather information, as temperature and humidity.\nExecute the URL directly in the browser to see the structure and information of the result object\nfetch('https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/api/current?lat=35&lon=160')\n  .then(function(response) {\n    console.log(response.status);\n    return response.json();\n  })\n  .then(function(myJson) {\n    //console.log(myJson);\n    console.log(myJson.main.temp);\n  });\n\nGet more information about fetch in Developer Mozilla: Using fetch\nExercise D (15 min)\nIn folder InClass/D-fetch do exercise.js\nGoing back to asynchronous programming, when the temperature will be printed?\nWhat if we have a code like this, predict the order of the console.log():\nconsole.log(\"Starting...\");\nlet URL = \"https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/api/current?lat=35&lon=160\";\nfetch(URL)\n  .then(function(response) {\n    return response.json();\n  })\n  .then(function(myJson) {\n    console.log(\"Temperature is: \" + myJson.main.temp);\n  });\nconsole.log(\"Finishing...\");\n\nHomework\n\nFrom the Javascript/Core Module 2 repository review and finish all exercises in the folder week-3/InClass\nComplete exercises in the folder week-3/Homework/alarmclock\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\nComplete the Homework Form, to notify mentors and add comments and questions about the exercises\n\nPractice Day (Saturday)\n\nCheck together, solve doubts and fix the Homework exercises\nComplete the exercises in the folder week-3/Homework\n[Optional] Complete the exercises in the folder week-3/Extra\nPush the changes to your repository in Github\n\n"},"js-core-3/":{"url":"js-core-3/","title":"JavaScript III","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core 3\nExample structure:\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\n\n\n\n\n1\nJSON  HTTP, AJAX, APIS\n\n\n2\nPromises  fetch\n\n\n3\nClasses and Object Oriented Programming\n\n\n\n"},"js-core-3/week-10/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-10/lesson.html","title":"Week 10 - ES6 and debugging","keywords":"","body":"\nJS Core III - 1\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nIntro to ES6\nTracing Code\nDebugging\nGood Design\nModules\nRefactoring\n\n\n\n\nFork and Clone the exercises-js3-week1 repo\n\nIntro to ES6\nECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) is a significant update to JavaScript that introduces\nnew syntax for writing complex applications. \nconst and let\nYou have already come across the var keyword as a way to create new variables.\nThe let and const keywords are also used for variable creation, but the\nvariables created using these keywords have different scope.

Let's see how it works.\n// before \nfunction sum(a, b, c) {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\n// ES6\nconst sum = (a, b, c) => {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\nIf the function only contains one expression, the curly braces and the return \nare optional and we can write the whole function in one line. \nconst sum = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;\n\nDefault parameters\nES6 allows us to declare defaults for function arguments. The default value is \nused when the argument/parameter is either missing or undefined. \nThis function returns the sum of three numbers. Let's assume we want to use the \nsame function with only two arguments: \n// without default parameter\nconst sum = (a, b, c) => {\n  c = c || 0;\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 3, 4)) // 8\nconsole.log(sum(2, 5)) // NaN\n\n// with default parameter \nconst sum = (a, b, c = 0) => {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\nconsole.log(sum(2, 5)) // 7\n\nDestructuring\nIn ES6 we can extract data from objects or arrays using destructuring. \n// before \nvar chicken = {\n  name: 'Maggie', \n  age: 2\n}\n\nvar name = chicken.name;\nvar age = chicken.age;\n\nvar numbers = [1, 2];\n\nvar firstNumber = numbers[0];\nvar secondNumber = numbers[1];\n\n\n// in ES6\nconst chicken = {\n  name: 'Maggie', \n  age: 2\n}\n\nconst { name, age } = chicken;\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2];\n\nconst [firstNumber, secondNumber] = numbers;\n\nResources:\n\nLet and const\nES6 features\n\nExercise\nFrom exercises-js3-week1 repo in folder InClass/A-ES6 do exercise1.js\nClasses\nObjects in programming languages provide us with an easy way to model data. Let’s say we have an object called polygon. The polygon object has properties: values that contain data about the polygon, and methods: functions that define actions that the polygon can perform. This focus on “objects” and “actions” is the basis of Object Oriented Programming.\nAnalyze the following code, what is a constructor?\nclass Polygon {\n  constructor(height, width) {\n    this.name = \"Polygon\";\n    this.height = height;\n    this.width = width;\n  }\n  sayName() {\n    console.log('Hi, I am a ' + this.name);\n  }\n}\n\nlet p = new Polygon(300, 400);\np.sayName();\n\nThe extends keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class as a child of another class.\nWhy do you think are two lines commented? \nclass Rectangle extends Polygon {\n  constructor(height, width) {\n    super(height, width);\n    this.name = \"Rectangle\";\n    this.sides = 4;\n    //this.area = this.height * this.width;\n  }\n  get area() {return this.width * this.height;}\n  sayName() {\n    console.log('Hi I am a polygon and my name is ' + this.name + '.');\n  }\n}\n\nlet r = new Rectangle(50, 60);\nr.sayName();\n//r.area = 3;\nconsole.log('The area of this polygon is ' + r.area);\n\nResources:\n\nClasses differences in ES5 and ES6\nExplanation of Classes\n\nExercise\nFrom exercises-js3-week1 repo in folder InClass/A-ES6 do exercise2.js\nTracing Code\nWhat is Code? Computer code is a set of rules or instructions. It is made up of words and numbers and when you put them in the right order it will tell your computer what you want it to do. \nLet's trace these code samples together:\n\nExercise 1 \n\nExercise 2 \n\n\nDebugging\nDebugging is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system.\nSyntax bugs\nA syntax bug is an error caused by something the programmer has typed – it could be a spelling mistake or a command that the computer doesn’t understand.\nLogical bugs\nA logical bug is an error which means that even though the computer is able to carry out its instructions, it doesn’t act as the programmer intended or the user expects.\nDebugging with Chrome\nFollow this tutorial about Debugging with Chrome\nAnd try to solve the problem in the link 'Open Demo'\nGood Design\nDesign is important if we want our code to be understandable (both to other\nhumans, but also to us in the future), to be easy to use and easy to expand.\nThere are three main principles you need to know now: clarity, reusability and\nextensibility. There are also others, but they are deeply related to these\nthree.\n\nEase of Maintenance / Clarity\n\nNaming\nCommenting\nClear logic\nConcise\nFormatting\nAvoiding Redundancy\n\n\nReusability\n\nDRY\nSingle Reponsibility\nAvoiding global state (scope)\nPredictability and Ease of testing\n\n\n\n\nExtensibility\n\nAvoiding being unnecessarily specific (e.g. magic numbers)\n\n\n\nNow let's take a look at a bigger example of a badly written function\nfunction myFunction(salary, taxCode, incomeTax1, incomeTax2, ownsCar) {\n  var totalIncomeTax = incomeTax1 + incomeTax2;\n  var studentLoan = (salary - 17775) * 0.09;\n  var originalSalary = salary;\n  var nationalInsurance = null;\n\n  if (taxCode === \"1150L\") {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.1;\n  } else if (taxCode === \"ST\") {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.05;\n  } else {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.08;\n  }\n\n  var deductions = [nationalInsurance, totalIncomeTax, studentLoan];\n\n  salary = salary - deductions[0];\n  salary = salary - deductions[1];\n  salary = salary - deductions[2];\n\n  return (\n    \"Your gross income is £\" +\n    originalSalary.toString() +\n    \" and your net income is £\" +\n    salary.toString() +\n    \".\"\n  );\n}\n\nconsole.log(myFunction(28000, \"1150L\", 1000, 580, false));\n\nComment together what is wrong with this function?\nExercise\nFrom exercises-js3-week1 repo in folder InClass/C-Good Design do exercise1.js\nRefactoring\nThere are times when we want to make our code better without changing any\nfunctionality, for example because we just learnt about a better way to solve a\ncertain problem (like, finding needles in haystacks). This is called\nrefactoring.\nWhen previously GREEN code - working code! - suddenly does not work anymore,\nwe call this a regression. Our existing tests can make sure that when we\nrefactor, the functionality of our code actually stays the same, and does not\nregress.\nModules\nSo far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs\ncan become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be\nmaintainable.\nWe can therefore split our code into so-called modules. A module is basically\na JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and\nprograms.\nCreating modules, exporting code\nIt is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module\nby exporting its functionality:\nfunction printName(name) {\n  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = printName;\n\nThe key here is the line containing module.exports. As you see, this is an\nassignment, and whatever is assigned to module.exports will be made available\nto other modules and program when this file is imported.\nUsing modules, importing code\nBut how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to import it,\nand this is done using a function called require().\n\nThere are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here,\nwhich is natively supported by Node, is called CommonJS.\n\nvar printName = require(\"./printName.js\");\n\n\nThe string passed to the require() function is a path to the file you are\nimporting. ./ signifies the current directory, so the above command will\nimport a file called \"printName.js\" that is in the same directory as our\nprogram.\n\nAssuming our program is in the same folder as printName.js, we can use the\nabove code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in\nthe printName variable.\nWe can then continue to use the printName function as if it we defined it in\nour own program!\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\nprintName();\n\nModules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already\nlearned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing\nmultiple functions.\nTogether: Edit the file modules/main.js and follow the instructions.\n\nResources\n\nJavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford, chapter 4 - Functions\nMDN Objects basics\nMDN OOP in JS\nModules\nSetup VS Code for Debugging\n\nTracing code resources\nCheck out these videos.

How the web works - quick recap\nIn this session we will look at how computer talk to each other using the web.\nAt the core of the web is the URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator. We use the term resource to mean anything that a server might return such as webpage, CSS, JavaScript, image, data etc. A good way to think of a URL is as an address. It allows us to refer to webpages, images, data etc that is stored on servers elsewhere.\nMethods\nThe main methods used to send requests on the web are GET and POST. However, later in the course when we look at building APIs using Node we will also look at other methods such as PUT and DELETE.\nA GET method is a way of asking a server for a webpage, resource or a piece of data. For example, when we type a URL into a browser and submit it. The browser will send a GET request.\nA POST method is used to send data to a server.\nThe main difference between GET and POST is that a POST method has a body, that is it can contain some data that we are sending. Whereas a GET does not have a body since we use it to request data.\nHeaders\nEach request and response sent has meta data, information about the data, at the beginning called a header. The header contains information such as a\n\nstatus code indicating whether a request was successful\ncontent type which indicates what the request or response contains\n\nas well as lots of other things we won't cover here\nStatus codes\nEach response returned needs to contain a status code which tells the client whether the request was successful. If the request succeeded the response code will be 200. If the resource you tried to access was not found the response code used is 404.\nSome status codes you may have come across before are:\n\n200 ok. Request was successful\n301 moved permanently. Used to redirect request when moved permanently\n401 Unauthorised. User credentials were not supplied\n404 Not found\n500 Internal server error\n\nThe response codes can be grouped into categories\n\n1xx: Informational\n2xx: Success\n3xx: Redirection\n4xx: Client Error\n5xx: Server Error\n\nIf you want a fun look at HTTP codes, take a look at https://httpstatusdogs.com/ or https://http.cat/ if you are cat person. For a technical perspective take a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes.\nContent type\nWhen sending data across the web, we need to specify in the header what the request or response contains. To do that, the content-type header is used. That way the receiver knows what to do with the data received.\nCommon content types include\n\ntext/html - HTML web page\ntext/css - CSS\nimage/jpeg - JPEG image\napplication/javascript - JavaScript code\napplication/json - JSON data\n\nExercise\nIn Slack post answers to the following\n\n- What can HTTP headers contain?\n- What is the purpose of status codes?\n- What can an HTTP message contain?\n2. What are APIs and how to interact with them\nExplanation\n\nAPI stands for Application Programming Interface\nAPIs are created by providers and used by consumers\nIt is a specific part of a larger system that can be contacted by other systems, for example from the internet.\nWhen we connect to an API we say that we are connecting to an Endpoint\nSome well-known APIs are Facebook APIs, Twitter APIs, Maps APIs and many many more\nIn particular, an API doesn't care what language or technology is used in the consumer or the provider\n\nAn API is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it. An example of a server is the application on a computer hosting a website and an example of a client is the browser on the phone trying to access the website.\nWhy do we need APIs?\nImagine that I am a big social network and I want to give developers all over the world access to the data on the people on my website.\nWhat are some problems that I would have with sharing my data with everyone?\n\nSome of the information that I have is public (for example, peoples names) whilst other information I have is private (for example, email addresses). I want to make sure that I only ever give developers access to peoples names but never to their email addresses - otherwise they could send them spam email.\nI want to make sure that when developers ask for my data I can control who has access to it. I like that my users data is being used to make their lives better but I don't like it when companies try to sell them new stuff they don't need.\nSome developers might want to change some of the users details on my social network and this would get very messy quickly if people where allowed to change whatever they wanted\n\nAn API is a special type of program what acts as a gatekeeper to all of this information. Having an API means that I can control which information is shared about my users and who it is shared with. Perfect!\nTypes of APIs:\n\nPrivate: for employees only under a company network for internal use.\nSemi-private: for clients who paid for the API.\nPublic: for everyone on the web (but may or may not need an account to use).\n\nExamples\nHere is the API endpoint for Transport For London\nhttps://api.tfl.gov.uk\nThe data from this endpoint will be used by many apps that you use every day - Google Maps and Citymapper to name two.\nThis endpoint will get location of all of the Bikepoints in London.\nhttps://api.tfl.gov.uk/BikePoint\nThat's a lot of Bikes! It would be better if we could search for a location. Luckily this API let's us search for places.\nhttps://api.tfl.gov.uk/BikePoint/Search?query=Clerkenwell\nThis API also has lots of other endpoints that we can use to get other data. For example, lets find the Air Quality of London.\nhttps://api.tfl.gov.uk/AirQuality\nAs you can see the URL changes the data that we get from the API. This can be broken down like this\n\nExercise\nTask (5 mins):\nLet's use the TFL API to get data about the London Underground\n\nhttps://api.tfl.gov.uk\n\n1.  Which endpoint would you use to find out if there is a disruption on the 'central' line? 2. Does the 'central' line have a disruption right now? Name another line that has a disruption on it.\n\nHint: Use your browser to access the endpoints\nRecap\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following statements below about APIs is false?\n\nA) Public APIs can be accessed by anyone on the Internet.\nB) You must use Javascript to access an API.\nC) APIs can control access to data or features of an application.\nD) You can change data via an API.\nQuestion:\nGive an example of a company that uses an API to allow access to their data.\n3. How to use fetch to do network requests\nExplanation\n\nFetch is a function to request from other places on the web\nFetch is defined in the browser which means it can be used without using an external library (window.fetch)\nFetch is available in nearly all browser but it's good to check which ones it won't work in\nWe can use this website to help us - caniuse.com)\n\n\nFetch API documentations by Mozilla link\n\nHow does fetch work?\nFetch uses a JavaScript pattern called \"Promises\" which has a very specific structure.\nYou can think of a Promise as you would think of a promise you make to another person - you make a promise that something will happen in the future. For example - I promise to call you later, I promise to go to the shops and buy milk later.\nUsing Promises allows us to schedule functions to be called after some asynchronous code finishes running. We can specify different functions depending on whether the asynchronous code was successful or ran into an error.\nPromises can make it easier to split our code into small functions and make code easier to read. They also make it easier to handle errors.\nIn this example we\n\nGet the Promise that we will get the milk from the shops (this could take a long time so it's good that it's a Promise!)\nWhen the milk has arrived from the shop then I should drink it and return the bottle so I can do something else with it\nWhen I've drank the milk then I should recycle the bottle\nIf anything goes wrong with those steps I should catch the error and warn everyone what happened\n\nExample\ngetMilkFromShops\n  .then((milk) => {\n    console.log(`I've got the milk`);\n    milk.drink();\n    return milk.bottle;\n  })\n  .then((bottle) => {\n    console.log(`I'm going to recycle the bottle`);\n    bottle.recycle();\n  })\n  .catch((error) => console.warn(\"Oh no, I dropped the milk\"));\n\nExample 1\nLive Coding Exercise\nLet's step through how the Fetch function is used and what it is comprised of\n//Retrieve the JSON\nfetch(\"https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts\")\n  // Get the response and extract the JSON\n  .then(function (response) {\n    return response.json();\n  })\n  // Do something with the JSON\n  .then((headlines) => {\n    console.log(headlines);\n  })\n  // If something goes wrong\n  .catch((error) => console.log(error));\n\nExample 2\nLive Coding Exercise\nWouldn't it be cool to make a new friend with just the click of a button?\nWrite a function that makes an API call using fetch to https://www.randomuser.me/api\n\nThe function should make an API call to the given endpoint: https://www.randomuser.me/api\nLog the received data to the console\nIncorporate error handling\nShow how you can build a profile page for the user using the DOM\nAdd a name\nAdd a profile picture\nAdd some styling using CSS\n\n\n\nError handling\nWe saw earlier that each HTTP response contains an status code which indicates if our request was successful or not. If the our request failed we usually want to handle it appropriately.\nWe can handle these errors gracefully in your code by checking the status and statusText value of the response:\nfetch(\"https://httpstat.us/500\")\n  .then((response) => {\n    if (response.status >= 200 && response.status  {\n    // do whatever you want with the JSON response\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    // Handle the error\n    console.log(error);\n  });\n\nRecap\nTask (5 mins):\nComplete the rest of this code to connect to the following API: `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`\n\n    fetch(_____)\n    .then(_____)\n    .then(body => console.log(body))\n    .catch(error => console.log(error));\nHomework\nFollow the steps and complete all the steps you can from the Weather Project\n"},"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html","title":"Week 12 - Project","keywords":"","body":"JS Core III - 3\nProject to be decided\n"},"react/":{"url":"react/","title":"React","keywords":"","body":"React\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\nHomework\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1\nReact 101\nReact 101 Homework\n\n\nWeek 2\nReacting to Changes\nReacting to Changes Homework\n\n\nWeek 2\nFetching Data\nFetching Data Homework\n\n\nWeek 4\nRouting (optional)\n\n\n\n\nOverall Learning Objectives - React module\nBy the end of the three lessons & homework, students should be able to build a React application:\n\nWritten with components\nAppropriately composed/nested\nSplit across multiple files\n\n\nUses props to pass values between components\nData like numbers/strings/objects/arrays\nFunctions as event handlers\n\n\nUses state to react to user interaction\nE.g. a button can be clicked to increment a counter\n\n\nThat fetches data from an API\nLoading, success and error states are shown\n\n\nContaining a form\nForm inputs that can be filled out by the user\nCan be submitted, triggering an update in the app\n\n\n\n\nFor advanced students, some further objectives would be:\n\nUse class components instead of function components/Hooks\nExplain why React state is used over plain old JavaScript variables\n\nOut of scope\nThese topics are considered out-of-scope:\n\nObject-Orientated JavaScript (classes/inheritance)\nDetails of extends/super() are not necessary to use React (they are an implementation detail of Component class), so don't go out of the way to teach this\n\n\nRedux\nWant to focus on learning and practising the basics of React, before introducing new concepts\nLearning Redux will be easier once confident with React\n\n\nCSS-in-JS\nIn depth functional programming\n\n\n"},"react/week-1/lesson.html":{"url":"react/week-1/lesson.html","title":"Week 13 - React 101","keywords":"","body":"React - Week 1\nBefore the class\nInstall a tool to create a react project with a command, go to the terminal and runnpm install create-react-app\nOnce installed, you can go to your working directory and run\nnpx create-react-app pokedex, which will create a project in a new folder named pokedex\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nReact 1\nWhat is React?\nWhat is a component?\nComponent tips\n\n\nRendering with React\nJSX\nLet's create a React app\nReact Components\nComponent Composition\nArrow Functions for shorter syntax\n\n\nEmbedding JavaScript into JSX\nKeys\nImporting/Exporting Components\nMaking an argument for Props\nWhat are Props?\nFurther reading\nCredits\n\n\n\n\nHomework\n\nWhat is React?\nReact is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. It is used for making complex, interactive user interfaces. It has become very popular in the last 5 years.\nWhy has it become so popular?\n\nIt is fast and efficient\nIt is easy to understand & less verbose than the \"vanilla\" JS API\nIt helps separate functionality into small, understandable pieces\n\nWhat is a component?\nReact heavily relies on a concept called \"components\". Components are like small Lego blocks for designing and developing user interfaces (UI). They can be stuck together in different ways to create new UI.\nLet's have a look at an example: the GitHub header. What are the logical \"pieces\" of UI? What could be a component?\n\nHere we've highlighted some elements that could be components:\n\nComponent tips\nThere are no hard & fast rules for making components. UIs can be split up into components in many different ways, requiring judgement based on your context.\n\nComponents should follow the Single Responsibility Principle\nEach component should only have 1 \"responsibility\"\nShould only do 1 thing\n\n\nComponents should have good, explicit names\nThis helps you to remember what the component's job is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise A (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Look at the example online shopping user interface in the Thinking in React article (the image at the top).\n\n\n2. Draw boxes around the components and give them names. Compare with the example components shown in the second image.\n\n\n\nRendering with React\nRemember how annoying it was to manage the DOM yourself in our previous lesson? The \"vanilla\" JavaScript APIs for updating the DOM are quite long and difficult to remember. React makes this easier by manipulating each DOM element itself, instead of you doing it manually. You give React a \"description\" of the DOM that you want and it will update the DOM for you. React abstracts away the management of the DOM.\nLet's take a look at an example. We are going to walk through how to render a  with the text \"Hello World\" within it.\nFirst, lets recap how we could do this using \"vanilla\" JS (interactive version):\nlet divNode = document.createElement(\"div\");\ndivNode.innerText = \"Hello World\";\n\nlet rootElement = document.querySelector(\"#root\");\nrootElement.appendChild(divNode);\n\nNow let's convert to using React (interactive version):\nconst element = React.createElement(\"div\", {\n  children: \"Hello World\",\n});\n\nconst rootElement = document.querySelector(\"#root\");\nReactDOM.render(element, rootElement);\n\nJSX\nAs you can see, React is already helping us a bit by cleaning up some of the verbose vanilla JS APIs. However in a typical React application you would still use a lot of the React.createElement function. To improve the developer experience the React team developed JSX.\nJSX is a simple syntax sugar that looks like HTML, but is actually converted to the React.createElement function when you run it.\nUsing JSX (interactive version):\nconst element = Hello World;\n\nconst rootElement = document.querySelector(\"#root\");\nReactDOM.render(element, rootElement);\n\nAs you can see, this is much easier to read than both the straight React.createElement API and the vanilla JS API. Most people using React use JSX to write their components.\n\n\n\nExercise B (estimate: 5 min)\n\n\n\n\nChange the JSX example from above to instead render a h1 tag with the text \"Hello Code Your Future\".\n\n\n\nLet's create a React app\n\n\n\nExercise C (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. If you haven't already, follow the instructions to create a React app called pokedex.\n\n\n\nWhat got created?\nDiagram of folder layout created by create-react-app. Click here for live diagram.\n\nReact Components\nWe looked at the beginning of the lesson at the concept of components. Now let's look at how components are made in React.\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\nfunction HelloWorld() {\n  return Hello World;\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.querySelector(\"#root\"));\n\nThere are 3 important parts in this code:\n\nFirst we import React. This is important because JSX is converted to React.createElement calls. If the React variable is undefined then this will fail.\nWe create a React component called HelloWorld.\nWe render the HelloWorld component into the element with the id of root.\n\n:::note Definition\nThe process of rendering is turning the JSX elements returned by the component function into DOM elements on the screen. This is done by React for you.\n:::\n\n\n\nExercise D (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. In the pokedex React app that you just created, open the src/App.js file.\n\n\n2. Delete everything in the file except the line containing export default App. You should see an error in your terminal and in your web browser - don't panic! We're going to remake the App component ourselves.\n\n\n3. Import the React variable from the React package.\n\n\n4. Create a function named App, which will be our component.\n\n\n5. Within the App function, return a  element with the text \"Welcome to the Pokedex\". What do you see in your web browser?\n\n\n6. Create a  element that wraps around the  you just created.\n\n\n7. Below the  element (but within the ), create an  element. Then make its src attribute equal to https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/016.png. What do you expect to see in your web browser?\n\n\n8. Now create a  element to wrap both the  element and the  element.\n\n\n\nComponent Composition\nA component can be combined with another component so that both are rendered. This is called composition (interactive example):\nfunction Greeting() {\n  return Hello;\n}\n\nfunction Mentor() {\n  return Ali;\n}\n\nfunction HelloWorld() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nIn the HelloWorld component we are using a reference to the Greeting and Mentor components. React reads these references when rendering HelloWorld and so it renders the Greeting and Mentor child components.\nWe are also using some shorter syntax within the HelloWorld component.  is just a shorter way of writing , which is useful if we don't need to put anything inside the Greeting component.\nNotice how the components that we write (HelloWorld, Greeting, Mentor) are written using a camel case convention and always start with an uppercase letter? And \"regular DOM\" components (div, span) are always lowercase? This is a convention to let you know whether you are using a \"regular DOM component\" or a component that you have written. When you're making your own components, you should always start them with an uppercase letter.\n\n\n\nExercise E (estimate: 5 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. In your pokedex React app, open the src/App.js file.\n\n\n2. Create a new function named Logo.\n\n\n3. Copy the  element and its contents and paste it into the Logo component.\n\n\n4. Replace the  element in the App component with the new Logo component.\n\n\n5. Create a new component function named BestPokemon and return a  element with some text saying which is your favourite Pokemon (e.g. \"My favourite Pokemon is Squirtle\").\n\n\n6. Render your new BestPokemon component below the Logo component within the App component.\n\n\n\nArrow Functions for shorter syntax\nBecause a React component is just a function, we can also use the arrow function syntax:\nconst HelloWorld = () => {\n  return (\n    \n      Hello World\n    \n  );\n};\n\nThis can be even shorter again if we use parentheses and implicit return:\nconst HelloWorld = () => (\n  \n    Hello World\n  \n);\n\nAlthough this is shorter, it is less flexible as we cannot insert code that is not JSX. Like for example, a console.log:\n// THIS DOES NOT WORK!\nconst HelloWorld = () => (\n  console.log('Hello!');\n  \n    Hello World\n  \n);\n\nIf we want to do this, we can still use arrow functions but we can't use the implicit return.\n\n\n\nExercise F (estimate: 5 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Using the pokedex React app that you created earlier, open the src/App.js file.\n\n\n2. Convert the Logo and BestPokemon functions into arrow functions.\n\n\n\nEmbedding JavaScript into JSX\nSo far all of the components we have looked at haven't been able to change - they are hard-coded. But this doesn't make very interesting websites, we want to be able to use variables with different data. We can insert variables (and some other things) into our React components.\nAnything in the JSX that is inside curly braces {} is interpreted as a regular JavaScript expression. That means you can use every object or function from JavaScript that we have learned so far. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nfunction Greeting() {\n  const greetingWord = \"Hello\";\n\n  return {greetingWord};\n}\n\nNow instead of hard-coding the greeting in the Greeting component, we are using a variable. Remember that everything between the curly braces is just regular JavaScript. So we can use more than just variables (interactive example):\nfunction Mentor() {\n  const mentors = [\"Ali\", \"Kash\", \"Davide\", \"German\", \"Gerald\"];\n  return {mentors.join(\", \")};\n}\n\nNow we have modified the Mentor component to use the Array.join method so that it lists several mentor's names. This also works with other JS types:\nfunction Addition() {\n  return {1 + 2 + 3};\n}\n\nfunction Weather() {\n  const weatherData = {\n    temperature: 5,\n    location: \"London\",\n  };\n\n  return (\n    \n      The temperature in {weatherData.location} is {weatherData.temperature}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nfunction formatName(user) {\n  return user.firstName + \" \" + user.lastName;\n}\n\nfunction Name() {\n  const user = {\n    firstName: \"Bob\",\n    lastName: \"Marley\",\n  };\n  return {formatName(user)};\n}\n\nA common pattern in React is to use Array.map to loop through a list of items and render a component for each one (interactive example):\nconst mentors = [\"Ali\", \"Kash\", \"Davide\", \"German\", \"Gerald\"];\n\nfunction MentorsList() {\n  return (\n    \n      {mentors.map((name) => (\n        {name}\n      ))}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nHere we are using Array.map to turn an array of strings into an array of components.\n\n\n\nExercise G (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Using the pokedex React app that you created earlier, open the src/App.js file.\n\n\n2. Inside the Logo component create a new variable called appName and assign it to \"Pokedex\".\n\n\n3. Now replace the hard-coded app name with {appName}. What do you see in your web browser? What would you do if you wanted to change the app name?\n\n\n4. Create a new component named CaughtPokemon. Within this component return a  tag with the text \"Caught 0 Pokemon on\" (we're going to fill in today's date in the next step).\n\n\n5. Create a variable named date within the CaughtPokemon component, and assign it today's date (hint: new Date().toLocaleDateString()). Finally, render the date variable after the text \"Caught 0 Pokemon on\".\n\n\n6. Render the CaughtPokemon component within the App component (below BestPokemon).\n\n\n7. Within the BestPokemon component, create a variable named abilities and assign it to an array with some Pokemon abilities (e.g. ['Anticipation', 'Adaptability', 'Run-Away']).\n\n\n8. Change the BestPokemon component to return a  element with the existing  element inside it. Then add a  element underneath the  element.\n\n\n9. Now use the .map() method on the abilities variable to loop over each name and return a  element for each (hint: look at the mentors list example above) within the  element.\n\n\n\nKeys\nYou may have noticed that we are now seeing a red error message in the Dev Tools: Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique \"key\" prop.. This error happens when you use Array.map to return a list of elements (interactive example):\nconst mentors = [\"Ali\", \"Sub\", \"Loic\", \"Anthony\", \"Lucy\", \"Mozart\"];\n\nfunction MentorsList() {\n  return (\n    \n      {mentors.map((name, index) => (\n        {name}\n      ))}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nHere we have added a key prop to the li element. A documentation page explaining in more depth is in the further reading section but basically the key prop has a special meaning in React because it is used internally to keep track of which element in the list is which.\nImporting/Exporting Components\nTo help organise your code, components can be imported and exported just like any other JavaScript code (interactive example):\nimport Greeting from \"./Greeting\";\nimport Mentor from \"./Mentor\";\n\nfunction HelloMentor() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nWe also need to export our components if we want to use them in other files:\nfunction Greeting() {\n  return Hello;\n}\n\nexport default Greeting;\n\nThe convention is to name component files exactly the same as the component (including the capital letter).\n\n\n\nExercise H (estimate: 5 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React app that you created earlier.\n\n\n2. Create a new file within the src directory named Logo.js.\n\n\n3. Copy and paste the Logo component from App.js into Logo.js.\n\n\n4. Remember to add import React from 'react' at the top of Logo.js.\n\n\n5. Export the Logo component from Logo.js (hint: look at the Greeting example above).\n\n\n6. Delete the old Logo component from App.js.\n\n\n7. Import the Logo component into App.js (hint: look at the HelloMentor example above).\n\n\n8. Repeat this process with the BestPokemon and CaughtPokemon components. What do you think the files should be called?\n\n\n\nMaking an argument for Props\nWhat's the problem with our HelloMentor component above?\nThe component HelloMentor is very static. What if we want to say hello to a different mentor? Currently, we would have to change the code too! This is easy in our tiny application but for \"real\" applications this might be more difficult.\nInstead wouldn't it be good if we could change which mentor we are saying hello to every time we render the component? So we could reuse the HelloMentor component for different mentor names. This is what props are for.\nWhat are Props?\nProps are what we use in React to pass \"arguments\" to components. They are very similar to arguments in functions - you can \"pass\" props to components, and you can use those props within a component.\nFirst let's look at passing props to your components (interactive example):\n\n\nAs you can see props are key-value pairs, in this example the key is name and the value is the string 'Mozafar'. We can pass as many props as we like to a component.\nWe don't have to use strings, we can use any valid JavaScript data like numbers, arrays and objects. Remember that in JSX you can use curly braces {} to inject data that is not a string:\n\n\nNow let's take a look at using props that we have passed to a component (interactive example):\nfunction Mentor(props) {\n  console.log(props);\n  return {props.name};\n}\n\nReact gives you access to props in the first argument to the component function. We can then inject props into our component using curly braces.\nThe props variable is just a normal object with key-value pairs that match what was passed to the component. Because it is just a variable, it can be used like any other variable. That includes injecting props into attributes:\n{props.name}\n\nOr calculating new values:\n{props.age + 1}\n\n\n\n\nExercise I (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Using the pokedex React app that you created earlier, open the App.js file.\n\n\n2. Pass a prop appName=\"Pokedex\" to the Logo component.\n\n\n3. Now open the Logo.js file.\n\n\n4. Delete the appName variable. What do you see in your web browser? Why?\n\n\n5. Change the Logo function to access the first argument and call it props. Use console.log to inspect the props variable.\n\n\n6. Change the usage of appName in the  to be props.appName instead. Does this fix the problem? Why?\n\n\n7. Now open the BestPokemon.js file.\n\n\n8. Copy the abilities variable and then delete it from BestPokemon.js.\n\n\n9. Paste the abilities variable into App.js.\n\n\n10. Pass the abilities variable as a prop to BestPokemon from App.js.\n\n\n11. In the BestPokemon.js file replace the existing usage of abilities with the abilities prop. You should still see the Pokemon ability names in your web browser.\n\n\n12. (STRETCH GOAL) Repeat the process with the date variable in the CaughtPokemon.js file.\n\n\n\nHomework\n\nIf you haven't already, complete the in-class exercises on your pokedex app\n(Delivery) Fork and clone cyf-hotel-react project and complete all of the lesson 1\n\n"},"react/week-2/lesson.html":{"url":"react/week-2/lesson.html","title":"Week 14 - Reacting to Changes","keywords":"","body":"React - Week 2\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nRecap\nHandling Events\nRe-Rendering Components\nState\nFetching Data in React\n\nRecap\nLast week we looked at how to write a HelloMentor React component (interactive example):\n```js title=\"Greeting.js\"\nfunction Greeting() {\n  return Hello;\n}\n\n```js title=\"Mentor.js\"\nfunction Mentor(props) {\n  return {props.name};\n}\n```js title=\"index.js\"\nimport Greeting from \"./Greeting\";\nimport Mentor from \"./Mentor\";\nfunction HelloMentor() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n## Handling events\n\nSo far we have only looked at React apps that are \"static\": they don't respond to user input. This week we will look at making our apps _dynamic_.\n\n### Recap: First-class functions in JavaScript\n\nBefore we look more at React we need to recap a concept in JavaScript. You may remember that functions in JavaScript are \"first class\" - that means we can pass a _reference_ to a function (as a variable) and then call it elsewhere. Let's look at an example ([interactive example](https://jsbin.com/xudukezaje/edit?js,console)):\n\n```js\nfunction hello() {\n  return \"Hello!\";\n}\n\nconsole.log(hello); // Logs: \"ƒ hello() {}\"\nconsole.log(hello()); // Logs: \"Hello!\"\nIn the example above hello is a reference to a function. In the first console.log we log out the whole function. The function is not called until we use parentheses (), so we only log the string \"Hello!\" in the second console.log.\nThis is a really important and useful in React, as we can make a function and pass it to React so that it can call it when a user interacts with our app.\nEvent handlers in components\nIn previous lessons we learned how to attach event listeners with addEventListener:\n// Create an event handler\nfunction logWhenClicked() {\n  console.log(\"buttonElement was clicked!\");\n}\n\n// Listen for events and call the event handler when triggered\nbuttonElement.addEventListener(\"click\", logWhenClicked);\n\nWe still need to listen to events in React, but event handlers are set up in a slightly different way (interactive example):\nfunction ClickLogger() {\n  function logWhenClicked() {\n    console.log(\"Button was clicked!\");\n  }\n\n  return Click me!;\n}\n\nEvery element in React has some special props that start with on that can be assigned to a function which will be called when the event is triggered.\nHere's a few examples (a full list is available here):\n\nonClick - the element was clicked\nonCopy - the clipboard is used to copy some text\nonKeyDown - a key is pressed down\nonBlur - the element loses \"focus\"\nonChange - only available for  &  (and a few others), triggered when changed\nonDoubleClick - the element was double-clicked!\nonPlay - a video starts playing\nonSubmit - a form element is submitted\n\nNotice that just like with addEventListener above, we pass the function reference to onClick instead of calling the function. If we call the function, it will run the function when we render, not when the user clicks on the button. (Remember that rendering is the term in React for inserting into the DOM).\n:::tip\nThink of it like this: we give the event handler to React, so that React can call our function when the element is clicked.\n:::\n\n\n\nExercise A (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application from last week and open the Logo.js file.\n\n\n2. Add a function named logWhenClicked within the Logo component. (Hint: look at the example above).\n\n\n3. In the logWhenClicked function, console.log a message (it doesn't matter what the message is).\n\n\n4. Add an onClick handler to the  that will call logWhenClicked. (Hint: look at the ClickLogger component above).\n\n\n5. In your web browser, try clicking on the logo image. What do you see in the JavaScript console?\n\n\n6. In a group of 2 - 3 students, discuss what would happen if you changed your code to onClick={logWhenClicked()}. Can you explain why?\n\n\n7. Report your discussion back to the rest of the class.\n\n\n\nPassing Functions as Props\nSometimes we need to pass a function to another component as a prop, so that it can handle the event.\nA common example for this is a Button component. This component adds some styling to a normal , but still needs to be able to pass an event handler function to onClick. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nfunction ClickLoggerApp() {\n  function logWhenClicked() {\n    console.log(\"Button was clicked\");\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n      Then look in the console.\n    \n  );\n}\n\nfunction FancyButton(props) {\n  return (\n    \n      Click Me!\n    \n  );\n}\n\nNotice how this is very similar to the example above where we created the handler and used it in the same component? The only difference here is that we are passing the function reference through a prop. We could even pass it through multiple components as props.\n\n\n\nExercise B (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application and open the Logo.js file.\n\n\n2. Copy and paste the logWhenClicked function from the Logo component to the App component.\n\n\n3. Pass the logWhenClicked function reference as a prop to the Logo component. (Hint: look at the ClickLoggerApp component above for an example).\n\n\n4. In the Logo component change the onClick prop so that it passes props.handleClick. (Hint: look at the FancyButton component above for an example).\n\n\n5. In a group of 2 - 3 students, discuss what you think will happen when you click the logo image now. Can you explain why?\n\n\n6. Report back to the rest of the class what you thought was going to happen and why.\n\n\n\nRe-rendering components\nSo far we've seen that when the page loads, React calls our function components. The JSX elements that are returned from the component functions are turned into the DOM for you by React.\nTo be able to react to changes, we need to re-render our function components to get different JSX elements. React can then update the DOM based on the new JSX elements.\nLet's look at how a component is re-rendered (interactive version):\nfunction Counter(props) {\n  console.log(`Rendering. props.likeCount is ${props.likeCount}`);\n\n  return Likes: {props.likeCount};\n}\n\nIf you look in the console, you'll see that the component is rendered once when the page loads. props.likeCount starts at 0, so React inserts \"Count: 0\" into the DOM.\nWe won't look at how this works at the moment, but behind the scenes there is some code that will listen for clicks on the button and force React to update. That means when you click the button, the function component is called again (or re-rendered).\nNow props.likeCount is 1. React now updates the DOM to make sure it shows the correct number. Every time we click the button, the function component is called and React updates the DOM for us.\nWe don't need to worry about changing the DOM ourselves! This is what makes React so powerful. Even better, React will figure out exactly the right bits of the DOM that need to be changed, a concept called the \"virtual DOM\". This makes it extremely efficient and fast.\nState\nState is a general concept in software engineering. It is used when a part of your app needs to \"remember\" something that changes when people interact with it.\n\nThis is a simple example, but if we had lots of bits of state, then we can make very complex apps.\nReact Hooks\nReact has built-in functionality for initialising and updating state in our components. We will access state via a React Hook called useState.\nHooks are a new-ish feature in React. You may find older tutorials that don't use Hooks, but don't panic. The concepts we learn here are the same whether or not you use Hooks. We are looking at Hooks first because they are simpler to learn for beginners.\nImporting useState\nTo be able to access the useState Hook, we first need to import it from the React package. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nconsole.log(useState);\n\nIf we look at the console, useState is just a function. It lives inside the React code that you installed when you created the app.\nTo reference the useState function in our component, we need to import it from the React code. The curly braces around useState are a bit like writing:\nimport React from \"react\";\nlet useState = React.useState;\n\nIn fact we can just write React.useState in our component if we want! But to type a bit less code, we import it (using the curly braces) once and then can just use useState.\nUsing useState\nNow let's look at how we can use the useState Hook (interactive example):\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return You clicked {count} times;\n}\n\nLet's break this down into small pieces. First, let's look at calling the useState function:\nuseState(0);\n\nThis initialises the state variable to 0. Any parameter passed to useState will be used as the initial value.\nNext, let's look at how we render the state variable in our component:\nreturn You clicked {count} times;\n\ncount is just a variable, so to insert it into our JSX we treat it like any other variable: we use curly braces.\nFinally, let's look at how we get hold of the count variable:\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\nTo fully understand this bit of code, we first have to understand destructuring. Let's look at this blog post by Wes Bos about array destructuring.\nNow we can understand that useState is returning an array, with two items. The first item in the array is the current value of the count state. In our example it will be 0 on the first render. The second item in the array is a function that we will use to update our state.\n:::tip\nFollow the useState naming convention.\n:::\nWhen we destructure an array, we can name the variables whatever we want, but there is a naming convention when destructuring the useState array. The first variable should be named whatever your state is called, and the second variable should be the same name but prefixed with set. Let's look at some examples:\nconst [userIsLoggedIn, setUserIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);\n\nconst [username, setUsername] = useState(\"chris\");\n\nconst [unreadMessages, setUnreadMessages] = useState(5);\n\n\n\n\nExercise C (estimate: 5 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open this CodeSandbox.\n\n\n2. Take a few minutes to read the code. Why do you think the app is broken?\n\n\n3. Initialise a new state variable with useState that will fix the app. Think carefully about how you should name the variables.\n\n\n4. Discuss with another student how you would create another state variable that represents the weather conditions (e.g. sunny, rain).\n\n\n\nUpdating State\nOur Counter isn't very useful right now! Let's make it more useful by getting count to actually count up (interactive example):\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function incrementCount() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      Click me\n      You clicked {count} times\n    \n  );\n}\n\nOur component now has a , which will call the incrementCount function when clicked:\nClick me\n\nThe incrementCount function then calculates the new state by adding 1 onto the current count. And then calls setCount to set the new state:\nfunction incrementCount() {\n  setCount(count + 1);\n}\n\nsetCount does two things. First, it updates the state that our component is \"remembering\". Whatever you pass as the argument to setCount will be remembered as the new state.\nIt also tells React that the old state that is still shown in the DOM is outdated and so the DOM needs to change. Because of this, React will re-render all of our components to figure out what to change in the DOM.\nWhen re-rendering, React will call our Counter component again, but this time when we call useState it will give us the updated state of 1, instead of the initial state of 0:\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  ...\n}\n\nOn the second render, count is now set to 1. Every time we click the button, the whole cycle starts again.\n\n\n\nExercise D (estimate: 15 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application and open the CaughtPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. Create a new state variable with useState. It should be named caught and be initialised to 0\n\n\n3. Within the JSX, there should be a \"hard-coded\" number 0. Replace it with your new caught state.\n\n\n4. Add a button to the component with an onClick handler that calls a function called catchPokemon.\n\n\n5. Create the catchPokemon function and have it update the caught state so that it is increased by 1 on each click. Click here if you are stuck.You will need to call the set state function (the 2nd item in the `useState` array) with `caught + 1`.\n\n\n6. Write down the things that will happen when you click the button. Compare your list with another student and discuss. Click here for a hint.The state will be updated to be the current state + 1. React is notified that our state has changed, so it re-renders. When rendering, the current state will be different and so React updates the DOM.\n\n\n\nDon't mutate State\nAs we just learned, setCount updates the state for us, but it also notifies React of changes. If you try to just change the count variable without using setState, nothing will happen, because React wouldn't be notified of the change. You can only modify (or mutate) state using the setter function (interactive example):\nfunction Counter() {\n  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    count = count + 1;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      Count: {count}\n      Click\n    \n  );\n}\n\nWhere does State live?\nWe have talked about how a component \"remembers\" state. In fact, each component instance remembers separate state from other components. This means we can have multiple different Counters, each with a different state (interactive example):\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nMore complex states\nThe examples we've looked at so far have used numbers, strings and booleans. You can also use arrays and objects in state too. Let's take a look at an example (interactive example).\nfunction ShoppingList() {\n  const [list, setList] = useState([]);\n\n  function addToList() {\n    setList(list.concat(\"Bread\"));\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      Add item to list\n      {list.map((item, index) => {\n        return {item};\n      })}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nIn this shopping list example, we're initialising the list state to be an empty array. To display our list we loop through the array (like we learned last week) and render an  for each item in the list.\nWhen we want to add something to the list, we can use the list.concat method to make a new array with the new item. This new array is then set as the new state. Right now, our example is not very useful as it can only add Bread to the list! Next week, we'll look at how we can allow users to write their own items to the list.\n:::tip\nDon't use the array push method with state. Instead use the array concat method.\n:::\nThe list.push method won't work here, as this method mutates the existing array. React requires a completely new array to be set as the new state, otherwise it doesn't realise that the value has changed. The concat method works because it copies the whole existing array to a brand new array before it adds the new item.\n\n\n\nExercise E (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application and open the CaughtPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. Change the useState to be initialised to an empty array ([])\n\n\n3. There will now be a bug in your app! We don't see how many Pokemon we have caught. Discuss with another student what you think the problem is.\n\n\n4. Change the JSX to instead render caught.length. Does this fix the bug?\n\n\n5. Let's now show the names of the Pokemon we have caught. Render a  element within the component. Then use the map method to loop through each item in the caught array and render it in an  element.\n\n\n6. Change the catchPokemon function to add a new Pokemon (it doesn't matter which one) onto the caught array. (Hint: use the concat method.)\n\n\n7. (STRETCH GOAL) Generate a random Pokemon each time you click the button Click here if you're stuck.[This StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4550505/getting-a-random-value-from-a-javascript-array) may be helpful.\n\n\n\nSetting multiple States\nSo far we've only seen an example with one state variable. But you can create multiple state variables if you want! Let's see an example (interactive example):\nfunction Weather() {\n  const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState(15);\n  const [conditions, setConditions] = useState(\"sunny\");\n\n  function makeItHotter() {\n    setTemperature(temperature + 1);\n  }\n  function makeItColder() {\n    setTemperature(temperature - 1);\n  }\n\n  function makeItSunny() {\n    setConditions(\"sunny\");\n  }\n  function makeItRainy() {\n    setConditions(\"rainy\");\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      Today's Weather\n      \n        Temperature will be {temperature}°C\n        The conditions will be {conditions}\n      \n\n      \n      +\n      -\n      Make it sunny\n      Make it rainy\n    \n  );\n}\n\nWhen do you use Props or State?\nWe've looked at the 2 main ways of managing data in our React components. But when should we use props and when should we use state?\nRemember that props are like \"arguments\" to a component. It's good practice to make sure that you don't modify arguments after you receive them. Just like state, React prevents you from mutating them. Let's have a look at an example (interactive example):\nfunction Greeting(props) {\n  function handleThing() {\n    props.name = \"Mozart\";\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      Hello {props.name}\n      Click me\n    \n  );\n}\n\nWhen you click the button, you might expect the name prop to change to \"Mozart\". But it doesn't! React has made props read-only, which is a reminder that we shouldn't change props.\nIf we were allowed to change props, React doesn't have a way of telling that we've changed the data. Our UI is now stale - not up-to-date with the latest data - and has no way of knowing that it has to re-render.\nFrom this we can get a clue about when to use state. If data changes over time, then we need to use state. My rule of thumb is that I always use props until I know that it needs to change over time, then I convert it to state.\n\n\n\nExercise F (estimate: 5 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open this CodeSandbox.\n\n\n2. Take a few minutes to read the code. Discuss with another student what you think will happen when you click on the highlighted word.\n\n\n3. Now click on the highlighted word. Can you explain why this happened?\n\n\n4. Fix the app so that clicking on the highlighted word will change the highlight color to purple.\n\n\n\nHomework\n\nIf you haven't already, complete the in-class exercises on your pokedex app\nComplete all of the lesson 2 exercises in the cyf-hotel-react project\n\n"},"react/week-3/lesson.html":{"url":"react/week-3/lesson.html","title":"Week 15 - Fetching Data","keywords":"","body":"React - Week 3\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nRecap\nUpdating Data Fetching when Props Change\nWorking with forms in React\n\nRecap\nLast week we looked at using props and state to create React components that change with user input (interactive example):\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function increment() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      You clicked {count} times\n      Click me\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default Counter;\n\nFetching Data in React\nOften when you create a React app, you will want to fetch data from an API and display it inside your components. How do we do this in React?\nYou might think that we could just fetch the data in the component like this, but unfortunately it won't work (interactive example):\n:::danger\nThis code won't work!\n:::\nfunction MartianPhotoFetcher() {\n  let imgSrc = null;\n\n  fetch(\n    `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&api_key=DEMO_KEY`\n  )\n    .then((res) => res.json())\n    .then((data) => {\n      imgSrc = data.photos[0].img_src;\n    });\n\n  console.log(`The image src is ${imgSrc}`);\n  return ;\n}\n\nThis is because React is synchronous, while fetch is asynchronous. If we look in the console, we'll see that the imgSrc will always be null when we try to render it. React will try to render before fetch has had time to get the data from the API.\n\nWe need a way of running the fetch call after we have rendered for the first time, so that it is not racing against React updating the DOM. Then once we have got the data back we can use state to tell React to re-render with the new data.\n\nThe way we do this is with another Hook, provided by React. This one is called useEffect.\nImporting useEffect\nJust like useState, we will import useEffect into our file like this (interactive example):\nimport React, { useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nconsole.log(useEffect);\n\nIf we look in the console, we'll see that useEffect is also a function like useState.\nOften, we will need to use useState and useEffect together. They are imported together like this:\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nUsing useEffect\nNow let's look at how to use the useEffect Hook (interactive example):\nfunction MartianPhotoFetcher() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(\n      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&api_key=DEMO_KEY`\n    )\n      .then((res) => res.json())\n      .then((data) => {\n        console.log(data);\n      });\n  }, []); // Always remember to put an empty array here!\n\n  return Hello useEffect!;\n}\n\nThe useEffect Hook takes two arguments:\n\nA callback function, where we can put our fetch call. In this example, we're fetching some data from the NASA API! ðŸš€\nAn array, which we'll look at later but is very important that you don't forget it!\n\n:::tip\nWhen writing your useEffect, write the \"skeleton\" first, then fill in the callback function later.\n// Write this bit first!\nuseEffect(() => {\n  // Write this bit later!\n}, []);\n\n:::\nYou might have noticed that we still haven't rendered the data from the API. We now need to tell React to re-render once we get the data. This sounds like a job for state!\nLet's look an example of how we can use state and useEffect to do this (interactive example):\nfunction MartianPhotoFetcher() {\n  const [marsPhotoData, setMarsPhotoData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    console.log(\"Fetching data from NASA\");\n\n    fetch(\n      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&api_key=DEMO_KEY`\n    )\n      .then((res) => res.json())\n      .then((data) => {\n        setMarsPhotoData(data);\n      });\n  }, []);\n\n  if (marsPhotoData) {\n    return ;\n  } else {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\nThe timeline of this component is now what we wanted at the start:\n\nThe component renders for the first time. Notice that we are returning null here: if a component returns null, then React will render nothing on-screen\nAfter rendering, the useEffect callback is run, so it fetches data from the NASA API\nWhen the response is received, we update the state\nThis causes a re-render so that we can show the data on-screen\n\nYou might notice that even though we re-rendered, we did not run the useEffect a second time. The way we've set it up, useEffect will only run after the first time a component renders. We'll look at controlling this in more detail later.\n\n\n\nExercise A (estimate: 15 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application again.\n\n\n2. Create a new file src/PokemonMoves.js, and copy/paste the code from this CodeSandbox.\n\n\n3. Render the PokemonMoves component inside the App component (underneath CaughtPokemon).\n\n\n4. Take a few minutes to read the code in the new PokemonMoves component. Discuss with another student why you think it doesn't work.\n\n\n5. Create a new state variable called pokemonData and initialise it to null. Click here if you are stuck.Check last week's lesson for a reminder on creating state variables.\n\n\n6. Now add a useEffect call, but leave the callback function empty for now. Make sure you remember to add the empty array after the callback function.\n\n\n7. Inside the useEffect callback, call the fetch function with this URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/.\n\n\n8. Add a .then handler into the fetch function (remember this needs to come immediately after the fetch call) which converts the response from JSON (hint: .then(res => res.json())).\n\n\n9. Add a second .then handler after the one we just added, where the callback function will receive an argument called data.\n\n\n11. Within the second .then callback function, log out the data that we just received (hint: console.log(data)). Inspect the data in the dev tools console. Is there any interesting data? (Hint: think about what the component is trying to render).\n\n\n12. Still within the second .then callback, set the pokemonData state to be the data object we received from the API.\n\n\n13. What happens in your browser? Do you understand why? If not, discuss it with another student. If you are both stuck, ask a Teaching Assistant.\n\n\n\nConditional rendering\nIn the MartianPhotoFetcher component above, we wrapped our JSX inside an if / else statement. This is common practice in React, as it allows us to show something different depending on the situation (for example if there is no data to display, show the user something else instead).\nYou may also see this done in 2 other ways:\nThe ternary operator ? :\nThe ternary operator follows this structure condition ? outputIfTrue : outputIfFalse (interactive example):\nreturn (\n  \n    {marsPhotoData ? (\n      \n    ) : (\n      Loading...\n    )}\n  \n);\n\nThe double ampersand &&\nThe double ampersand && is used when you don't have an else. The implication is that when the condition is not fulfilled, nothing will render (interactive example):\nreturn (\n  \n    {marsPhotoData && (\n      \n    )}\n  \n);\n\nYou'll notice in the && example above, we do not render a 'Loading...' message, because there is no alternative output (no else case).\n\n\n\nExercise B (estimate: 5 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex application and the src/PokemonMoves.js file.\n\n\n2. Change the if / else statement in your JSX to use the ternary operator (condition ? outputIfTrue : outputIfFalse) instead.\n\n\n\nThe Circle of Life\nWe now know how to fetch data and render it in our React applications. However, there was a problem with the method that just learned. To understand this problem we first have to understand the lifecycle of a component.\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n\n\nExercise C (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open this CodeSandbox.\n\n\n2. Take 5 minutes to read the code.\n\n\n3. Click the \"Fetch image for 2019\" button. If you're feeling confident: predict what is going to happen before you click the button.\n\n\n4. Now click the \"Fetch image for 2020\" button. What did you expect to happen? What actually happened? Can you explain why?\n\n\n\nTogether let's \"play computer\" to break down exactly what is happening with these components:\n\nWhen the page loads, the App function component is called\nIt doesn't have any date state already, so we initialise it to an empty string (\"\") with useState\nIt renders the 2 buttons, but because date is an empty string, it does not render the MartianImageFetcher component. Instead null is returned, which means that nothing is rendered\n\n  function App() {\n    const [date, setDate] = useState(\"\");\n\n    ...\n\n    return (\n      \n        Fetch image for 2019\n        Fetch image for 2020\n\n        {date ?  : null}\n      \n    );\n  }\n\n\nWhen we click the \"Fetch image for 2019\" button, the handle2019Click click handler is called\nThe state is set by setDate to be \"2019-01-01\", and a re-render is triggered\nThe App function component is called again\nThis time, useState remembers that we have date state and it is set to \"2019-01-01\"\n\n  function App() {\n    ...\n\n    function handle2019Click() {\n      setDate(\"2019-01-01\");\n    }\n\n    ...\n\n    return (\n      ...\n      Fetch image for 2019\n      ...\n    );\n  }\n\n\nNow App does render MartianImageFetcher and passes the date state as a prop named photoDate\nThe MartianImageFetcher function component is called for the first time\nuseState knows that we haven't got any imgSrc state so initialises it to null\nWe queue an effect, which will run after we render for the first time\nBecause the imgSrc state is set to null, we return null. This means that nothing is rendered\n\n  function MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n    const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n      ...\n    }, []);\n\n    if (!imgSrc) {\n      return null;\n    } else {\n      return ;\n    }\n  }\n\n\nNow that the component has rendered for the first time, the effect is run\nA fetch request is made to the NASA API\nWhen the request data comes back, we set the imgSrc state to a piece of the data, which triggers a re-render\n\n  function MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n    ...\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n      fetch(\n        `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${\n          props.date\n        }&api_key=gnesiqnKCJMm8UTYZYi86ZA5RAnrO4TAR9gDstVb`\n      )\n        .then(res => res.json())\n        .then(data => {\n          setImgSrc(data.photos[0].img_src);\n        });\n    }, []);\n\n    ...\n  }\n\n\nThe MartianImageFetcher function component is called again\nuseState remembers that the imgSrc state is set to the data from the API\nThis time, we do not queue an effect. We set up useEffect with an empty array ([]), which means that we only run after the first render\nWe do have imgSrc state set, so we render the image using the data from the API ðŸŽ‰\n\n  function MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n    const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);\n\n    ...\n\n    if (!imgSrc) {\n      return null;\n    } else {\n      return ;\n    }\n  }\n\nPhew! That was a lot of work just to render an image! But we're not quite done yet, we still need to find out what happens when we click the \"Fetch image for 2020\" button:\n\nIn the App component, the handle2020Click click handler is called\nThe date state is set to \"2020-01-01\" and a re-render is triggered\nThe App function component is called again and the date state is set to \"2020-01-01\"\nThe date prop that is passed to MartianImageFetcher is different which means that it has to re-render\n\n  function App() {\n    ...\n\n    function handle2020Click() {\n      setDate(\"2020-01-01\");\n    }\n\n    ...\n\n    return (\n      ...\n      \n        ...\n        Fetch image for 2020\n        ...\n        {date ?  : null}\n        ...\n      \n      ...\n    );\n  }\n\n\nIn the MartianImageFetcher component useState remembers that we already had imgSrc state. It is set to the image from 2019\nAgain, we do not queue the effect because this is a re-render and useEffect has been passed an empty array []\nBecause imgSrc state has been set previously we render the image from 2019\n\n  function MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n    const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n      ...\n    }, []);\n\n    return ;\n  }\n\n\n\n\nExercise D (estimate: 5 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Did you spot where the bug was? Discuss with a group of 2 - 3 students where you think the bug is.\n\n\n2. Report back to the rest of the class where you think the bug happened.\n\n\n\n\nClick here to reveal the answer!\n\nThe key that the `useEffect` in `MartianImageFetcher` is **only run once**. This is because we told React that the queue should be queued on the first render only. However, as we saw, sometimes you need the effect to run again when some data changes. In this case the `date` prop, changed from `\"2019-01-01\"` to `\"2020-01-01\"`, meaning that we have to fetch data different data. We call this a _dependency_ of the effect. Any variables which are used inside the `useEffect` callback function are dependencies.\n\n\n\nuseEffect dependencies array\nTo solve this problem, we can tell React to queue the effect on the first render and when a dependency changes. We do this by adding the dependency variable to the array (interactive example):\nfunction MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n  const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    ...\n  }, [props.photoDate]);\n\n  ...\n}\n\nNow when the photoDate prop changes, React knows that the effect must be run again, this time with the 2020 date. Because of this behaviour, the second argument to useEffect is called the dependencies argument. We use it whenever we have something in our effect function that depends on a variable outside of the effect function.\nHere's a diagram showing when the useEffect callback will be run:\n\nTo help you understand this better, try \"playing computer\" again, but this time think about what happens when we use [props.photoDate] for the dependencies argument. Think carefully about what changes with step 6 after we click the 2020 button.\n\n\n\nExercise E (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application.\n\n\n2. Create a new file src/PokemonMovesSelector.js. Copy/paste the code from this CodeSandbox into the new file.\n\n\n3. Open src/App.js and replace the PokemonMoves component with the PokemonMovesSelector component (remember to update the import too!)\n\n\n4. Take a few minutes to read what the PokemonMovesSelector component does. If you have questions, ask a Teaching Assistant to help. We won't need to make any more changes to this component.\n\n\n5. Open the PokemonMoves component again. Change the URL to use backticks (`...` ) instead of double-quotes (\"...\"). Then replace the hard-coded number 1 with ${props.pokemonId}. What will this do? Click here if you don't knowThe URL will contain the pokemonId instead of always fetching the Pokemon with id of 1\n\n\n6. Open your browser and find where the PokemonMovesSelector component is rendered. Before you click the buttons, think about what you expect will happen. Then click the \"Fetch Bulbasaur\" button to find out what actually happens.\n\n\n7. Refresh the page. What happens now if you click the \"Fetch Bulbasaur\" button, then click the \"Fetch Charmander\" button? Is this what you expected? Discuss with another student why this happens.\n\n\n8. Fix the bug by adding props.pokemonId to the useEffect dependencies array in PokemonMoves. Remember that you can test if the bug still happens by refreshing the page, clicking one of the buttons, then the other button.\n\n\n\nESLint rules for React Hooks\nAs you may have noticed, VSCode highlighted the empty dependencies array when you changed the URL passed to fetch in PokemonMoves.\nThis is because your React application is using the rules from eslint-plugin-react-hooks, a package created by the developers who make React. It helps you to find bugs in React Hooks code by highlighting places where you might be missing dependencies.\nIf you see a red squiggly line underneath your useEffect dependencies array, you can hover your mouse over and it will tell you which variable is missing so you can add it to the dependencies array. Here's an example:\n\nWorking with forms in React\nModern web applications often involve interacting with forms such as creating an account, adding a blog post or posting a comment. This would involve using inputs, buttons and various form elements and being able to get the values entered by users to do something with it (like display them on a page or send them in a POST request). So, how do we do this in React?\nControlled component pattern\nA popular pattern for building forms and collect user data is the controlled component pattern. A pattern is a repeated solution to a problem that is useful in multiple similar cases. Let's have a look at an example (interactive example):\nfunction SimpleReminder() {\n  const [reminder, setReminder] = useState(\"\");\n\n  function handleChange(event) {\n    setReminder(event.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n      Today I need to remember to... {reminder}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nWe're controlling the value of the input by using the value from the reminder state. This means that we can only change the value by updating the state.\nIt is done using the onChange attribute and the handleChange function which is called every time the input value changes (typically when a new character is added or removed).\nIf we didn't call setReminder in the handleChange function, then the input's value would never change and it would appear as if you couldn't type in the input! Finally, the value we keep in the reminder state is displayed on the screen as today's reminder.\nIn addition, instead of just saving the value of the input in the state, we could have also transformed the string before we set it with setReminder, for example by calling toUpperCase() on the string.\n\n\n\nExercise F (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application.\n\n\n2. Create a new file src/PokemonCity.js. Copy/paste the code from this CodeSandbox into the new file.\n\n\n3. Open the src/App.js file and render the new PokemonCity component (underneath PokemonMovesSelector).\n\n\n4. Take a few minutes to understand what the PokemonCity component does.\n\n\n5. Add an  element above the  element.\n\n\n6. Set the value attribute of the  to the city state.\n\n\n7. Create a function within the component called updateCity. Pass this function to the onChange event handler.\n\n\n8. Change the updateCity component so that it has a parameter named event.\n\n\n9. Add a console.log to inspect the value of event.target.value. What happens when you type in the input?\n\n\n10. Using setCity, update the city state to what was typed in the input box.\n\n\n\nForm with Multiple Fields\nLet's have a look at a more complex example where we want to build a form to let users enter information to create a personal account (interactive example):\nfunction CreateAccountForm() {\n  const [username, setUsername] = useState(\"\");\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState(\"\");\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState(\"\");\n\n  function handleUsernameChange(event) {\n    setUsername(event.target.value);\n  }\n  function handleEmailChange(event) {\n    setEmail(event.target.value);\n  }\n  function handlePasswordChange(event) {\n    setPassword(event.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nWe now have three different inputs named username, email and password. There is a corresponding state variable and change handler function for each value.\n\n\n\nExercise G (estimate: 10 min)\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application again and open the src/CaughtPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. Render an  before the  (hint: ).\n\n\n3. Create a new state variable called pokemonNameInput and initialise to an empty string (\"\").\n\n\n4. Add a value attribute to the  which is set to the pokemonNameInput state variable. (Hint: value={pokemonNameInput})\n\n\n5. Create a new handleInputChange function within the component.\n\n\n6. Add a onChange handler to the  that will call handleInputChange.\n\n\n7. Add a parameter called event to the handleInputChange function. Set the pokemonNameInput state variable to event.target.value. Try typing in the  again. What happens now?\n\n\n8. Change the catchPokemon function to add the pokemonNameInput state to the caught array (hint: change the value that we are passing to the concat method)\n\n\n9. Open your browser, type a Pokemon name into the  and click on the \"Catch Pokemon\" button. Do you see your new Pokemon being added to the list?\n\n\n10. Empty the  after clicking on the button. To do this, set the state of pokemonNameInput to an empty string \"\" after we have added it to the caught array in the catchPokemon function.\n\n\n11: (STRETCH GOAL) Make sure the user cannot add a Pokemon to the caught state if the value of pokemonNameInput state is empty.\n\n\n\nInlining event handlers\nWe could make our code a bit shorter if we inlined our event handlers (interactive example):\n setUsername(event.target.value)}\n/>\n\nCentralising event handlers\nSometimes we need to put all of our update logic in one function, maybe because we need to validate the user's input before we set it in state.\nWe can use a single handleChange function, that is reused to keep track of changes for all of the form fields. To be able to tell which  is being updated, we check the event.target.name field. This corresponds to the name attribute on the  (e.g. ).\nBased on this value, we then decide which state to update (interactive example):\nfunction handleChange(event) {\n  if (event.target.name === \"username\") {\n    setUsername(event.target.value);\n  } else if (event.target.name === \"email\") {\n    setEmail(event.target.value);\n  } else if (event.target.name === \"password\") {\n    setPassword(event.target.value);\n  }\n}\n\nForm submission\nSo far, our form examples don't have a way of sending the user data back to the server, so that we can store it in the database.\nWe will be using a special submit event triggered on the  element. This event is triggered when the user clicks a submit button or if they hit the Enter key. Let's take a look at an example (interactive example):\nfunction CreateAccountForm() {\n\n  ...\n\n  function handleSubmit(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n\n    console.log(\"Sending data to server\");\n\n    fetch(\"https://httpstat.us/200\", {\n      method: \"POST\",\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        username: username,\n        email: email,\n        password: password\n      }),\n      headers: {\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n      }\n    });\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      ...\n      Submit\n    \n  );\n}\n\nWe set up our  to handle the event by passing the handleSubmit function to the onSubmit prop. If we click on the Submit button or hit Enter while focused on the form, the event is triggered and the handleSubmit function is called.\nThe first thing we do inside the handler function is call event.preventDefault(). This is necessary because the browser has a default action when the submit event is triggered on the form to send a GET request to the server. We prevent the default action because we will handle the event ourselves.\nWe can then do whatever we want with our user data! In this example, we're sending a POST request using the fetch method.\nFurther Reading\nContainer components\nThere is a common pattern when loading data in React applications, called container components.\nRead more about it here.\nMultiple fields as state pattern\nThere is another common pattern for handling multiple fields in a form, but it requires some JavaScript functionality that you may not have seen before.\nRead more about it here.\nHomework\n\nIf you haven't already, complete the in-class exercises on your pokedex app\nComplete all of the lesson 3 exercises in the cyf-hotel-react project\nTry to complete the Stretch Goal exercises in the cyf-hotel-react homework\n\n"},"react/week-4/lesson.html":{"url":"react/week-4/lesson.html","title":"Routing (optional)","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to React-Router\nIn the past few weeks, you've learned how to build applications with React and the different applications and examples were all built on a single page. However, what if you wanted to have different pages with each page having its own URL (so you can bookmark it for example)? You will need to introduce a router in your application. In JavaScript, a router is the piece of code which is in charge of switching between views of your application and keep each view in sync with a specific URL. For example, you could imagine having a homepage reachable from the root path / and a users page with the path /users. In React, a popular library to help you achieve this is React-Router.\nLet's look at a first example (interactive example):\nconst Index = () => {\n  return Home;\n};\n\nconst About = () => {\n  return About;\n};\n\nconst Users = ({ names }) => {\n  return (\n    \n      Users\n      \n        {names.map((name) => (\n          {name}\n        ))}\n      \n    \n  );\n};\n\nconst AppRouter = () => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              Home\n            \n            \n              About\n            \n            \n              Users\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n        \n         }\n        />\n      \n    \n  );\n};\n\nReact-Router provides some default React components that you can use to enable routing in your application. First, notice the top level  component which wraps everything else. Each route is defined with the  component which maps a path (defined with the path props) with a React component. In the simplest case, you can specify the React component to map to the path with the component props. However, it is assuming you don't need to pass any props to it. If you face a more complex scenarios or if you need to pass props to your React component, you can use the render props which takes a function and return exactly what you want to render on this path. Then, the Link component can be used to create links to navigate to different routes.\n\nExercise A\nOpen the pokedex React application. In this exercise, React-Router will be introduced. Instead of displaying all your components in the same page, we will use React-Router to define different pages in the pokedex application.\n\nIn the terminal, install React-Router with npm install --save react-router-dom.\nOpen src/App.js and import BrowserRouter, Route and Link components from React-Router (hint: import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from \"react-router-dom\";)\nWrap all the components in the render method in the  component.\nIn the following, we will have CaughtPokemon and BestPokemon displayed with different route. But first, let's create some links to navigate to different pages. Still in the render method of src/App.js, use the Link component to create 2 links: one to navigate to the URL /best-pokemon and another one to navigate to /caught-pokemon (hint: Best Pokemon).\nOpen the pokedex in your browser and verify that you can see 2 links on the page. When clicking on each of these links, the URL in your browser address bar should change (but nothing will change on the screen yet!).\nNow let's define the routes to map a path to a React component. First, create a route to map /best-pokemon to the BestPokemon component. Then, use another route to map /caught-pokemon to the CaughtPokemon component (Hint: depending on if you pass some props to BestPokemon or CaughtPokemon you will need to use either the component or the render props in the  component).\nOpen the pokedex in your browser and verify that when clicking on each link, BestPokemon and CaughtPokemon are rendered accordingly.\n\n\nURL parameters\nSometimes, parameters can be passed from the URL to a React component directly via its props. In this case, different URLs can be mapped to one single React component. For example, in an online shopping application, a React component Product may be responsible to display a specific product on the page. By using URL parameters, the name or ID of the requested product can be specific in the URL and React-Router will pass it a props of the Product component (interactive example):\nconst Product = ({ match }) => {\n  return Product: {match.params.name};\n};\n\nconst AppRouter = () => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n        \n          Product List\n          \n            \n              Laptop\n            \n            \n              TV\n            \n            \n              Teddy Bear\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n    \n  );\n};\n\nIn the route definition above, a specific syntax is used to define the URL parameter: :name. Then in the Product component, the value of name can be accessed through the component props match.params.name.\n\nExercise B\nIn the following, we will create a new component to display a Pokemon information. The Pokemon name will be passed through the URL and displayed on the screen.\n\nCreate a new component PokemonInfo.\nIn src/App.js, create a new route which maps the path /pokemon/:name to the previously created component PokemonInfo (hint: ).\nIn the render method of PokemonInfo component, display the name of the Pokemon which is passed in the URL parameter (hint: use the props match.params.name).\nOpen the pokedex in your browser and try several URLs (such as http://localhost:3000/pokemon/Pikachu and see if the Pokemon name is displayed accordingly on your screen.\n(STRETCH GOAL) Instead of passing the name of the Pokemon in the URL parameter, now pass an ID. The ID passed correspond to the ID of the Pokemon in the Poke API. For example, the ID 1 corresponds to the Pokemon Bulbasaur (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/1/). In the PokemonInfo component, use the Pokemon ID from the URL to load the corresponding Pokemon data from the Poke API and display the following Pokemon information on the screen: name, color.name, shape.name, base_happiness and capture_rate.\n\n\nFurther Reading\nA lot of examples are available on the official React-Router website.\n"},"react/classes-optional/lesson.html":{"url":"react/classes-optional/lesson.html","title":"Class components (optional)","keywords":"","body":"React Class Components (Optional)\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nClass Components\nState in Class Components\nUnmounting\nClass Component Lifecycle\nFetching Data with Class Components\n\nClass Components\nSo far we have looked at components which are just functions (which are called function components), but there is another way of creating React components using the class keyword. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\n\n// Class component\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return Hello;\n  }\n}\n\n// Function component\nconst Greeting = () => {\n  return Hello;\n};\n\nInstead of getting props through the first argument of the component function, the class component gets props from this.props (interactive example):\nclass Mentor extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.name};\n  }\n}\n\nHere are the steps to follow to convert from a function component into a class component:\n\nImport the Component variable by changing the React import to: import React, { Component } from 'react';\nCreate a new class that extends the component: class MyComponentName extends Component {}\nInside the class, create a render method: render() {}\nCopy and paste the contents of the function component into the render method\nReplace any references to props with this.props\nDelete the old function component\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application that you created last week.\n\n\n2. Convert the Logo component from a function component into a class component.\n\n\n3. Convert the CaughtPokemon component into a class component.\n\n\n4. Convert the BestPokemon component into a class component.\n\n\n\nWhen you should use function components or class components?\nClasses are an older method for creating components in React. Even though they are older, they will still continue to work for a long time. Because of this, there are many React components written using classes. You will likely still encounter them when developing with React.\nBefore Hooks were released classes were the only way to access state and lifecycle (similar to effects). The rule of thumb now is that new components should be written using function components with Hooks, but class components don't need to be updated.\nClass Methods\nClass methods are similar to nested \"handler\" functions inside function components. Let's take a look at an example (interactive example):\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\n\nclass Hello extends Component {\n  sayHello = () => {\n    console.log(\"Hello from Hello component!\");\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return Say hello;\n  }\n}\n\nUnlike nested functions, we can't use just the name of the function in the onClick prop. We have to use this first, because the method is attached to the class.\nNotice how we use a slightly different syntax for the sayHello method than the render method? There is a reason for this, but it is quite complicated and mostly irrelevant. The rule of thumb is to always use this syntax:\nmethodName = () => {\n  // ...\n};\n\nExcept for the render method (and a handful of others which we'll talk about later).\n\n\n\nExercise B\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application and open the Logo.js file.\n\n\n2. Add a method named logWhenClicked to the Logo component (hint: remember to use the correct syntax).\n\n\n3. Within the logWhenClicked method, console.log a message (it doesn't matter what the message is).\n\n\n4. Add a onClick handler to the  that will call this.logWhenClicked (hint: look at the Hello component above).\n\n\n5. In your web browser, try clicking on the image. What do you see in the JavaScript console?\n\n\n\nState in Class Components\nAccessing state in class components is a bit different than with function components. We're going to use the Counter component we looked at previously:\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function increment() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      Count: {count}\n      Click me!\n    \n  );\n}\n\nNow let's look at the equivalent version in a class (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    count: 0,\n  };\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState({\n      count: 1,\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Count: {this.state.count}\n        Click me!\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThere's a lot going on here! Let's break it down into pieces.\nState initialisation\nUnfortunately, React prevents us from using useState inside class components and we have to use alternatives. To initialise state we have to assign a class property called state:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    count: 0,\n  };\n}\n\nThis creates a new state variable called count. Any value you assign will be the initial value of the state variable, so here we initialise to 0.\nUnlike useState, you can initialise multiple state variables at once, like this:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    count: 0,\n    isCountingDown: false\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\nDefining the increment handler function\nAnother difference in the class is that we don't define a \"normal\" function as the increment handler function. We also don't define it inside the render method, as you might expect.\nInstead we define increment as a class method (see above for a reminder):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  ...\n\n  increment = () => {\n    ...\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\nThis also means that we have to change how we use the handler function in our JSX:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  ...\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        ...\n        Click me!\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAccessing state variables\nSince we can't use useState, it also means that we don't have access to the count variable. Instead our count state lives inside this.state:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  ...\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Count: {this.state.count}\n        ...\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nWe have just swapped count with this.state.count. Otherwise it works exactly the same.\nUpdating state with this.setState\nThe final piece is how we update state variables. Again, because we can't use useState, we don't have access to setCount. Instead we use a special function called this.setState:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  ...\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState({\n      state: 1\n    })\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\nThis function is similar to setCount because it does two things:\n\nUpdates the state variable\nTriggers a re-render\n\nOne difference is that this.setState can update multiple state variables at once:\nthis.setState({\n  state: 1,\n  isCountingDown: true,\n});\n\nUpdating state based on previous state\nYou may have noticed that our Counter app isn't very useful. It can only count to 1! This is because this.setState has one more difference: if you need to update some state based on the previous state, then we need to pass a callback instead of an object (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    count: 0,\n  };\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState((previousState) => {\n      return {\n        count: previousState.count + 1,\n      };\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Count: {this.state.count}\n        Click me!\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can count up as much as we like!\nThis is because React can \"delay\" this.setState executing for performance reasons. By using a callback function, we ensure that we are computing the new state with the correct version of the old state and not an outdated one. This problem is one of the reasons why useState was created.\nRecap\nLet's recap what we've learnt about React state:\n\nWe initialise state by assigning a state class property to an object with whatever initial state we want (e.g. { something: 'hello' })\nWe can read or render state by using the this.state variable (e.g. this.state.something)\nWe can change state using the this.setState() method and by passing the piece of state we want to update (e.g. this.setState({ something: 'hi' }))\nIf we need to read the previous state to be able to calculate the new state, then we must use a callback function with this.setState() (e.g. this.setState((previousState) => { return { something: previousState.something + 1 } }))\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application and open the CaughtPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. Set the initial state by assigning the state class property to an object. Then make the initial state have 0 caughtPokemon.\n\n\n3. Change the CaughtPokemon component to render this.state.caughtPokemon instead of hard-coding 0. Do you expect anything to have changed in your web browser?\n\n\n4. Add a  with the text \"Catch Pokemon\" to the CaughtPokemon component.\n\n\n5. Create an catchPokemon method within the CaughtPokemon class.\n\n\n6. Add a onClick handler to the  we just created that will call the catchPokemon method.\n\n\n7. Within the catchPokemon method, use this.setState() to change caughtPokemon to 1.\n\n\n8. Update the catchPokemon method to increase the number of caughtPokemon by 1 every time the button is clicked (hint: we need to use the previous state to calculate the new state).\n\n\n\nUnmounting\nSo far we've looked at components that are always rendered in the browser. However (and this is often the case in large applications), we might want to control whether components are shown or not. Let's look at a Toggle component (interactive example):\nconst Message = () => I'm shown when this.state.isShown is true âœ…;\n\nclass Toggle extends Component {\n  state = {\n    isShown: false,\n  };\n\n  toggle = () => {\n    this.setState((previousState) => {\n      return { isShown: !previousState.isShown };\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.state.isShown ?  : null}\n        Toggle\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nIf you open up dev tools, you will see that the element changes based on the isShown state. The hidden element is not hidden with CSS, it is actually removed from the DOM. This is because this.state.isShown is false which means the Toggle component returns null for that part of the JSX. If you return null in JSX then React will render nothing at all.\nClass Component Lifecycle\nWhen a class component is within the DOM, we call it mounted. When a component is removed from the DOM, we call it unmounted. When we change state like in the unmounting example above, we can switch between these statuses. This gives us a clue that components go through a lifecycle of different statuses. We have seen 2 of the statuses: mounting and unmounting, there is also a third called updating.\nWe can hook into this lifecycle through special component methods that are added by React's Component class. They are run at different points of the lifecycle, often before and after they change to a different status. The method names contain will or did based on whether they run before or after a status change.\nThis diagram shows the React component lifecycle:\n\nLet's look at how we can use one of the lifecycle methods (interactive example):\nclass Lifecycle extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    console.log(\"componentDidMount\");\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return Hello World;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex application that we have been working on for the last 2 weeks and open the CaughtPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. Add a componentDidMount method to the CaughtPokemon component. Within this method add a console.log('componentDidMount'). You don't need to return anything from this method.\n\n\n3. Repeat the same step above with the componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount methods.\n\n\n4. Try interacting with the CaughtPokemon component in your web browser (clicking the button) while looking at the JavaScript console. What order do the logs appear?\n\n\n5. The componentWillUnmount method will never be called. Can you explain why?\n\n\n\nWe'll now focus on a few of the lifecycle hooks and see how they are used.\ncomponentDidMount and componentWillUnmount\nThe componentDidMount method runs after a component has finished rendering to the DOM. The component is now waiting for a props change or input from the user. It is called only once. We use this lifecycle hook to make changes outside of the component (sometimes these are called side effects).\nThe componentWillUnmount method runs when a component has been unmounted from the DOM. It is used to \"clean up\" the component as it is no longer being shown. Often we need to close down or cancel the changes we made in componentDidMount.\nTo look at these in more detail, we'll create a Clock component in an exercise.\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n1. Open this CodeSandbox.\n\n\n2. Now change the Time component (notice that there are 2 components defined in this file) add a componentDidMount method.\n\n\n3. Within the componentDidMount method use setInterval to call this.tick every 1000 milliseconds (hint: setInterval(this.tick, 1000)).\n\n\n4. Now open the JavaScript console your web browser. What is happening? Can you explain why?\n\n\n5. Keep looking at the JavaScript console and try clicking the \"Toggle time\" button. What do you think the problem is here? How can we fix it?\n\n\n6. Change the componentDidMount method to assign this.timer to the output of setInterval (hint: this.timer = setInterval(this.tick, 1000))\n\n\n7. Add a componentWillUnmount method to the Time component\n\n\n8. In the componentWillUnmount method, remove the timer by calling clearInterval(this.timer)\n\n\n9. Try clicking the \"Toggle time\" button again, like in step 5. How have we solved the problem?\n\n\n\nFetching Data with Class Components\nData fetching with class components is also a bit different than with Hooks. The problem is similar to accessing state, because we can't use useEffect inside our class components. Instead we can use the class component lifecycle.\nThe component lifecycle is very important - we don't want to be calling our API at the wrong time, or multiple times with the same data! If we tried to fetch data in our render method, it would make a request every time props or state changed. This would create lots of unnecessary requests. A similar problem is solved when using useEffect by the dependencies array.\nAs we saw above, componentDidMount is called only once when the component is first rendered and so it is an ideal place for making requests. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nclass MartianPhotoFetcher extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(\n      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${this.props.date}`\n    );\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // We don't don't what the img src is when we render :(\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\nThis example isn't very useful! We can't use the data returned from the server in render because the request is asynchronous :( We need React to re-render once the request is resolved - a perfect use for state! Let's look at an example (interactive example)\nclass MartianPhotoFetcher extends Component {\n  state = {\n    imgSrc: null,\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(\n      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${this.props.date}`\n    )\n      .then((res) => res.json())\n      .then((data) => {\n        this.setState({\n          imgSrc: data.photos[0].img_src,\n        });\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can see the Martian photo that we fetched from the server!\nHowever we have a bit of a problem - when we first render the component, we don't have the photo src yet. We first have to initialise it to null. This shows us that we're missing something from our UI - a loading status.\nLet's look at showing a different UI when the request is loading (interactive example):\nclass MartianPhotoFetcher extends Component {\n  state = {\n    isLoading: true,\n    imgSrc: null,\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(\n      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${this.props.date}&api_key=gnesiqnKCJMm8UTYZYi86ZA5RAnrO4TAR9gDstVb`\n    )\n      .then((res) => res.json())\n      .then((data) => {\n        this.setState({\n          isLoading: false,\n          imgSrc: data.photos[0].img_src,\n        });\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.isLoading) {\n      return Loading... ðŸ‘½;\n    } else {\n      return ;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHere are the steps that the component takes:\n\nInitialise isLoading to true\nIn render, show a loading message because isLoading is true\nOnce rendered, componentDidMount will trigger the API request\nWhen the request resolves, we set the isLoading state to false and set the data that we want\nChanging state triggers a re-render, and because isLoading is false we render the Martian photo\n\nWe can still improve our component! What happens if we make a request that fails? Our request will error, but we won't show the error in the browser. Let's see how we can fix it (interactive example).\nFirst we have to deal with annoying quirk of fetch. You may remember that it doesn't reject the promise on HTTP errors. The fix is to add another .then before we convert to JSON:\n.then((res) => {\n  if (res.ok) {\n    return res;\n  } else {\n    throw new Error('HTTP error');\n  }\n})\n\nNow we can add our solution - a .catch on the fetch call. Here we reset the loading state and add the error to state.\n.catch((err) => {\n  this.setState({\n    isLoading: false,\n    err: err\n  });\n})\n\nNow we can check if there's an error in state and render out an error message:\nrender() {\n  if (this.state.isLoading) {\n    return Loading... ðŸ‘½;\n  } else if (this.state.error) {\n    return Something went wrong ðŸ˜­;\n  } else {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application again and open the src/BestPokemon.js file.\n\n\n1. If you haven't already, convert the BestPokemon component to a class component.\n\n\n2. Set the initial state to have a key named pokemonNames that is assigned to an empty array [].\n\n\n3. Add a componentDidMount method to the component.\n\n\n4. Within the componentDidMount method call the fetch() function with this URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokedex/1/. What will this do?\n\n\n5. Add a .then() handler into the fetch function (hint: remember this needs to come immediately after the fetch() call) which converts the response from JSON (hint: .then(res => res.json()))\n\n\n6. Add a second .then() handler after the one we just added, where the callback function will receive an argument called data.\n\n\n7. Within the second .then() callback function, log out the data that we just received (hint: console.log(data.pokemon_entries[0].pokemon_species.name)).\n\n\n8. Now change the console.log() to log out an array instead, with the first, fourth and seventh Pokemon (hint: console.log([data.pokemon_entries[0].pokemon_species.name, data.pokemon_entries[3].pokemon_species.name, data.pokemon_entries[6].pokemon_species.name])).\n\n\n9. Now again within the .then() callback function, call this.setState() to set the pokemonNames key and assign it to the array that we just logged out (you can copy/paste it).\n\n\n10. Inside the render method, remove the old pokemonNames variable and replace it with this.state.pokemonNames. What do you see in your web browser?.\n\n\n11. Add an isLoading piece of state, which is initialised to true.\n\n\n12. When calling this.setState() inside the .then() handler, also set isLoading to false.\n\n\n13. In the render method check if this.state.isLoading is true and return a loading message (e.g. Loading...). Otherwise if this.state.isLoading is false then render the loop as we did before.\n\n\n14. (STRETCH GOAL) Add some error handling which renders an error message.\n\n\n15. (STRETCH GOAL) Explore the data returned from the API. See if you can show some more interesting Pokemon information in your app (hint: try console.logging different data returned from the API).\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\nConverting a class component to a function component with Hooks\n\n"},"node/":{"url":"node/","title":"Node/DB","keywords":"","body":"Node\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\nWorkshop\n\n\n\n\nweek-16\nNode, Express workshop\nExpress Workshop\n\n\nweek-17\nMore Express\nNew API Workshop \n\n\nweek-18\nIntroduction to SQL\n\n\nweek-19\nMore SQL and integration with NodeJS\n\n\nweek-20\nMore integration with NodeJS\n\n\n\n"},"node/week-13/lesson.html":{"url":"node/week-13/lesson.html","title":"Week 16 - Node and Express 101","keywords":"","body":"Node - Week 1\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson students should be able to:\n\nExplain what is a server and how works node\nUse Glitch to deploy and edit express servers\nUse npm to start a node server\nExplain what express is and what it is used for\nUse express to create an API that will accept a GET request that returns JSON\nImplement routing to return different resources depending on URL\nImplement query params to return different content (?query=ses)\n\n\nIntro to Servers and Node\nWhat is a server?\nServers are computer programs that receive requests from other programs, the\nclients and send back a response e.g share data, information or hardware and\nsoftware resources.\n...and what is a server in plain English?\nA server is a computer program. Its job is to send and receive data.\nLet's take a website for example. A website is just a collection of HTML and CSS\nfiles, images, maybe some javascript files. When you type a website address in\nyour browser's address bar, the browser (client) sends a request to the\nserver that lives at that address. The browser asks the server to give it the\nfiles it needs to display the website properly. Another client can be a mobile application.\n\nNode and its ecosystem\n\nNode.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on\nChrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven,\nnon-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.\n\nWhat is the difference between javascript in a browser and Node?\n\nJavascript is a popular programming language and it runs in any web browser with a good web browser.\nJavaScript is mainly used for the client-side activity for one particular web application. Some of these activities can be dynamic page display in some schedule time interval, addressing business validation or basic Ajax call kind of task.\nNode.js is an interpreter and environment for the JavaScript with some specific useful libraries which JS programming can be used separately.\nNode.js can connect to other Internet Services: send emails, create communications in other protocols, etc.\nNode.js is mainly used for running or accessing any operating system for the non-blocking operation. Like:\nexecuting or creating a shell script\naccess to the hardware, for example the hard disk\n\nIf we execute this Node script, what would happen?\nconst fs = require('fs');\nfs.writeFileSync('hello.txt', 'Hey!!');\n\nExpress\nExpress is one of the most widely-used frameworks for\nNode.js. It simplifies base features of Node.js, making it easier and faster to\nbuild your application's backend. Learning Express gives you a great foundation\nfor becoming a Node.js developer.\nIntro to Node on Glitch\nRunning a very simple web-server\nRun the simplest web server code.\nWe've made a really simple server about cats.

You will always need to build\na server when writing back-end code. A server can be built in pure Node.js, but\nExpress is simpler to work with.\n1. Create a server.js file\nLet's build our server! Before we do anything, let's create a new file called\nserver.js. This is where all our server code is going to live.\n2. require the express library\nWe already installed Express in Step 2, but we need to make sure it is included\nin this file specifically so we can use its methods. In Node.js, when\nyou want to use a package in another file, you must require it.\nTo require Express, write the following inside server.js:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\n\n\nLet us get used to ES6 syntax - so use const and let instead of\nvar, arrow methods instead of functions, etc...\n\n3. Initialise the server\nTo initialise our server, we need to call the express() function. This\nwill create an Express application for us to work with.\nAdd the second line of code to your server.js file:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\n4. Start 'listening' for potential requests\nOne more step left, we need to set a port for our server to listen to. Think\nof a port as a door number; any requests that come to the server will come via\nthat door. Setting a port will allow us to find where our server is running.\nWe use the app.listen method to do this. This method takes two arguments:\na port and a callback function telling it what to do once the server is\nrunning.\n\nNeed clarification? Read more about the app.listen method in the Express documentation.\n\nWe're going to run our server on port 3000, and add a simple console.log in the callback function. Update your server.js file, calling the app.listen method:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nTry to use ES6 arrow functions instead of function.\n\n5. Switch the server on!\nYou've built your server, but it isn't running yet. We need to run a command in\nthe terminal to do this. We are going to use the node keyword to run the\nserver file.\nType the following command in your terminal:\nnode server.js\n\nIf you see this, congratulations! You have built yourself a server!\n\n6. npm script\nTo exit the running the server, type crtl + c. Instead of running the server with node server.js everytime, we can create an alias for it in package.json.\nUnder the scripts property, add start: node server.js. We can now run our server using npm start which will be an alias (a shortcut) to node server.js.\nGo to the terminal and type npm start and make sure that the server still runs.\nStep 3 - Communicating with the server\nNow that we've built the server, we need to communicate with it. We are going to\ncontrol the server with handler functions.\nWhat is a handler function?\nWhen a request reaches the server, we need a way of responding to it. In comes\nthe handler function. The handler function is just a function which receives\nrequests and handles them, hence the name.\nThe handler function is always called with a request and response object. The response object is what gets sent back to the client. It contains the information that gets displayed in the web page. You can decide what to send back in your response.\nWhat does a handler function look like in Express?\nThe get() method is one of the methods used to\ndefine a handler function in Express. It takes two parameters: the endpoint\nat which to trigger an action (we'll explain more about this in the next step),\nand the handler function that tells it exactly what to do. Here's a simple\n\"Hello World!\" example:\n// req is the Request object, res is the Response object\n// (these are just variable names, they can be anything but it's a convention to call them req and res)\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\nHere, we are telling our server to respond with \"Hello World!\" when someone\ntries to access the webpage.\n1. Create your own handler function\nLet us add a handler handler function to send back a message to the client. To do that,\nwe're going to use the Express send()\nmethod. This will update the\nresponse object with the message.\nUpdate your handler function like so:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Yay Node!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Try to console.log the request object inside the handler\nfunction. Restart your server, send the request again with Postman, then go to your terminal\nto see what it looks like. You should see a lot of data come through.\n\n2. Check it out in Postman\nQuit your server in the terminal with ctrl + c. Then restart it to run your\nnew changes.\nnode server.js\n\nNow, open Postman, and send a GET request to\nhttp://localhost:3000. If you see your message in Postman,\ncongratulations! You just sent your first response from the server.\n\nCheckpoint: Do you understand all these terms? You should be able to see examples of them in Postman\n\n\n Client\n Server\n Front-end\n Back-end\n Full stack developer\n Request\n Response\n HTTP\n HTTP Response Codes\n HTTP Request Methods (or Verbs)\n\nStep 4 - Routing\nAt the moment our server only does one thing. When it receives a request from\nthe / endpoint, it sends back the same response: \"Yay Node!\".\n\nTry typing http://localhost:3000/node and see what happens.\n\nHowever by making use of endpoints, we can make the server send different\nresponses for different requests. This concept is called routing.\nWhat is an endpoint?\nAn endpoint is the part of the URL which comes after /. For example:\n/chocolate is the \"chocolate\" endpoint. It's the URL to which you send a\nrequest.\nWhat is URL?\n\nCreate your own endpoints and send different responses\nWe're going to try sending different responses at different endpoints. Remember\nthe app.get() method? To set up routing in your server, we just need to repeat\nthis method with different endpoints.\nFor example:\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.get(\"/chocolate\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Mm chocolate :O\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add some code so that your server sends one message when the\nendpoint is /node and another one when it's /migracode.\n\nStep 5 - Query Parameters\nSo, what is a query parameter?\nIn simple terms, a query string is the part of a URL (Uniform Resource Locater) after the question mark (?). It is meant to send small amounts of information to the server via the url. This information is usually used as parameters to query a database, or maybe to filter results. It's really up to you what they're used for.\nHere is an example of a URL with query strings attached:\n\nhttps://stackabuse.com/?page=2&limit=3\n\n1. Detect Query Parameters\nWe're going to try sending different responses at different endpoints. Remember\nthe app.get() method? To set up routing in your server, we just need to repeat\nthis method with different endpoints.\nFor example:\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n  let searchQuery = req.query.search;\n  res.send(\"Hello World! You searched for \" + searchQuery);\n});\n\n\nExercise: Follow the instructions of node-challenge-calculator\n\nHomework\nFork and clone the quote-server repo\n"},"node/week-14/lesson.html":{"url":"node/week-14/lesson.html","title":"Week 17 - More APIs in Node","keywords":"","body":"Node - Week 2\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson students should be able to:\n\nDefine what each part of CRUD is and what it does\nProcess a GET request using Express and Node to retrieve data from memory\nProcess a POST request using Express and Node and store data in memory\nProcess a DELETE request using Express and Node to remove data from memory\nInstall a third party library using npm\n\n\nCRUD Continued\nSo what will we build? we will build a CRUD API. CRUD stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete. If you think about it, this is what most applications do:\n\nCreate some \"resources\"\nRetrieve them (GET them)\nUpdate them\nDelete them\n\nBelow are three in-class exercises which can be used to demonstrate parts of the API workshop below.\n(1) Get Exercise\nThis is an Teacher led exercise which can be used to show how we might retrieve an element by ID using a GET request.\nObjective\nChange a quote API server to allow GETting a quote according to the given ID.\nThe id should be given in the URL structure like this:\n\n/quotes/2\n\nYou should use the starting project: cyf-quotes-id-start. This is because this project has quotes with IDs.\nWhen you remix the starting project, immediately rename it as your own.\n(2) Post Exercise\nThis is an Teacher led exercise which can be used to show how we might add an element to an array\nObjective\nChange a quote API server to allow POSTs of new quotes.\nThe new quotes should be added to your quotes list, which is just an array in memory.\nYou can assume the POSTed quotes are all in the correct JSON format.\nThe route should use the HTTP method POST and should use the URL:\n\n/quotes\n\nYou should use the starting project: cyf-quotes-post-start, NOT your own existing quote server. This is because our project has an HTML form for creating new quotes.\nWhen you remix our starting project, immediately rename it.\nThen you can visit / and submit the form there, when you are ready to try to submit new quotes!\n(3) Delete Exercise\nThis is an Teacher led exercise which can be used to show how we might remove an element to an array\nObjective\nChange a quote API server to allow updating a quote according to the given ID.\nThe id should be given in the URL structure like this:\n/quotes/2\nYou should use the delete HTTP method\nYou should use this starting project: cyf-quotes-id-start, NOT your own existing quote server. This is because this project has quotes with IDs.\nWhen you remix the starting project, immediately rename it as your own.\nWorkshop\nYou can use this Express Cheatsheet to help you.\nAPI stands for Application Programming Interface.\nRead this description of what an API from How To Geek.\n\nThink of an API like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant’s kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes. You don’t know exactly how the restaurant prepares that food, and you don’t really need to.\nSimilarly, an API lists a bunch of operations that developers can use, along with a description of what they do. The developer doesn’t necessarily need to know how, for example, an operating system builds and presents a “Save As” dialog box. They just need to know that it’s available for use in their app.\n\nAn API does not have to be web-based. But in our work, since we are doing web development, we will work only with web based APIs, so you might as well hear the word Web Service, and we will communicate with those services using the protocol for Web: HTTP.\n\nCheckpoint: Let us recap what we know about HTTP before continuing.\n\nObjective\nOur API will manage Beyoncé albums:\n\nCreate a new album,\nRetrieve a list of albums or a single album,\nUpdate an existing album's information\nDelete an album\n\nWe will build these endpoints:\nGET /albums should return all the albums\nGET /albums/:albumId should return a single album (that matches the passed albumId)\nPOST /albums should save a new album\nPUT /albums/:albumId should update the album (that matches the passed albumId)\nDELETE /albums/:albumId should delete the album (that matches the passed albumId)\nGET /Albums\n\nIn server.js Add the endpoint for GET /albums.\n\nconst albumsData = [\n  {\n    albumId: \"10\",\n    artistName: \"Beyoncé\",\n    collectionName: \"Lemonade\",\n    artworkUrl100:\n      \"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music20/v4/23/c1/9e/23c19e53-783f-ae47-7212-03cc9998bd84/source/100x100bb.jpg\",\n    releaseDate: \"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z\",\n    primaryGenreName: \"Pop\",\n    url:\n      \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PeonBmeFR8o?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0\",\n  },\n  {\n    albumId: \"11\",\n    artistName: \"Beyoncé\",\n    collectionName: \"Dangerously In Love\",\n    artworkUrl100:\n      \"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/18/93/6d/18936d85-8f6b-7597-87ef-62c4c5211298/source/100x100bb.jpg\",\n    releaseDate: \"2003-06-24T07:00:00Z\",\n    primaryGenreName: \"Pop\",\n    url:\n      \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViwtNLUqkMY?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0\",\n  },\n];\n\napp.get(\"/albums\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(albumsData);\n});\n\n\nTest the endpoint with Postman. GET /songs should return a JSON reply with the array we specified.\n\nAdd another item to the array and test that the GET /songs returns three items. (Remember you need to close the server ctrl+c and run it again node server.js)\n\n\nStep 1: GET /albums/:albumId\nComplete in-class (1) GET Exercise at this point\nSometimes, we do not want to list all the information in one request, maybe we only want to get the information related to a single album. Imagine if we have a page to display the details of one album, we could call the server and get all albums then filter the one we need client-side, but would it not be more effective to tell the server to just return the one album we are interested in?\nLet us add a new endpoint to return only a single album GET /albums/:albumId. In this case, albumId will tell us what album we can return so the call will be something like GET /albums/10 and that will return the album with that has albumId 10 ()\nThis endpoint has something different. The endpoint /albums/:albumId has a dynamic part, the albumId will vary depending on what the client send. If we call /albums/12 then albumId is 12, if we call /albums/10 then we will return the album with albumId 10 and so on.\nHow can we achieve that using express - req.params will have the value of\napp.get(\"/albums/:albumId\", function (req, res) {\n  // req.params.albumId will match the value in the url after /albums/\n  console.log(req.params.albumId);\n  // now we can use the value for req.params.albumId to find the album requested\n  // how do we \"find\" something in an array\n\n  // finish the code yourself - it should end with res.send(album) where album is the single album you found  based on the id\n});\n\nStep 1.1 - Install nodemon\nIt is a bit annoying that we have to kill and restart our server every time we want to test our changes. There is a handy npm package that can help us with that task.\nnpm install --save-dev nodemon\nMake sure the package is added to your package.json, add this line to the script:\nscripts: {\n  start: \"node server.js\",\n  dev: 'nodemon server.js'\n}\n\nnow from your terminal, use the command npm run dev and that will run the server with nodemon which is a package that makes the server listen to code changes and automatically restart.\nStep 2: Add a new album\nComplete in-class (2) Post Exercise at this point\n\nOur analogy with the Restaurant menu is somewhat incomplete. In a restaurant, we only GET items from the menu. In the world of APIs, we also have the possibility to create items, we can provide ingredients to create a new dish. In this case, we provide some data (a payload) and we use a different verb POST (Create) as opposed to GET.\n\nPOST /albums should save a new album and return 200 with JSON { success: true } to the user.\n// notice .post (not .get)\napp.post(\"/albums\", function (req, res) {\n  console.log(\"POST /albums route\");\n});\n\nLet's start by testing using Postman. Do a POST request to the endpoint and make sure it prints the console.log message we have added.\n\nIn Postman, change the request method to POST instead of GET and test our endpoint. It should log the message to the terminal but the request will hang because we did not end it, i.e. we did not say res.send(something)\n\nSo what format does the client send the data with? It is up to us, but since we already are familiar with json, let us use it.\nIn order for our server-side to receive and use the data sent by the client. We will need to install and use a middleware.\n\nMiddleware: We will cover middleware in more details in the next class. For now, imagine them piece of code that process a request and pass them to the next middleware until one of them returns a response (with res.send for example)\n\nExpress Body Parser makes it easier for our endpoints to receive and understand different formats of data.\nFirst install the package: npm install body-parser --save\nconst bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json()); // before our routes definition\n\nNow we will receive the data as req.body.\napp.post(\"/albums\", function (req, res) {\n  console.log(\"POST /albums route\");\n  console.log(req.body);\n});\n\n\nExercise: Use Postman to POST this data to /albums endpoint.\n\n{\n  \"albumId\": \"13\",\n  \"artistName\": \"Beyoncé\",\n  \"collectionName\": \"B'Day (Deluxe Edition)\",\n  \"artworkUrl100\": \"http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/6c/fc/6a/6cfc6a13-0633-f96b-9d72-cf56774beb4b/source/100x100bb.jpg\",\n  \"releaseDate\": \"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z\",\n  \"primaryGenreName\": \"Pop\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQ9BWndKEgs?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0\"\n}\n\n\nFinish the code for the route POST /albums to add the album data to the albums list (how to amend to an array?)\n\nStep 3: Delete an album\nComplete in-class (3) DELETE Exercise at this point\nLets look back at our original objectives.\n\nDELETE /albums/:albumId should delete the album (that matches the passed albumId)\n\nThis means that DELETE /albums/2 should delete an album with the id 2 and return 200 with JSON { success: true } to the user.\nThe code will look like this\n// notice .delete\napp.delete(\"/albums/:albumID\", function (req, res) {\n  console.log(\"DELETE /albums route\");\n});\n\nCan you work out how to remove an album using this code?\nHomework\nFork and clone the chat-server repo\n"},"db/week-1/lesson.html":{"url":"db/week-1/lesson.html","title":"Week 18 - Introduction to SQL","keywords":"","body":"Database 1: Introduction to SQL\n\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nIntroduction to databases\nWhy do we need them?\nDifferent types of database\n\n\nIntroduction to PostgreSQL\nWhat is SQL?\nWhat is a RDBMS?\nWhat characterises a relational database?\nDatabase modeling exercise\nCheck your PostgreSQL installation\n\n\nCommunicating with the database using SQL\nCreating a new database\nCreating a table\nDBeaver, a SQL client software\nInserting data\nRetrieving data\nRetrieving data with conditions\n\n\nHomework\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson students should be able to\n\nExplain why databases are needed in Web Development\nDefine what SQL is and what it is used for\nDescribe what table, rows and columns are used for in a relational database\nInstall and create a database using PostgreSQL\nCreate a table in a database using PostgreSQL\nInsert data into a table using PostgreSQL\nRetrieve data from a table using PostgreSQL\nRetrieve data from a table using conditionals in PostgreSQL\nList the different kinds of data that can be held in a PostgreSQL database\n\n\nIntroduction to databases\nA database is a structured set of data held in a computer. It provides ways to store, retrieve and organize information.\nWhy do we need them?\nIn the past few weeks, you stored and retrieved data using files. This is fine for simple data but it can quickly become an issue as your application becomes more complex and needs to store and manipulate more complicated data. For example, imagine you want to develop the next biggest hotel booking application. You will need to store the list of hotels available for booking somewhere, and as you add more features, you will need to save users information, the reviews they post for each hotel, but also the bookings each user makes. You can see that the data you need to handle can become very complicated, especially when you need to consider that data are not static, as they can be updated or deleted. To work more effectively with data, we can then use a database, which present the following benefits:\n\nA database defines a structure for your data and the relationships between entities\nA database provides convenient and performant ways to safely store and retrieve data\nA database provides a mechanism to check the validity of your data\n\nDifferent types of database\nThere are many different kinds of database and different implementations. Sometimes, a database type is a better fit to certain use case or certain problems. The most well-known database types include relational database, key/value database, graph database and document database (also known as NoSQL). For this class, we will focus specifically on relational database as they are the most widely used and supported. You can consult DB-Engines to see a ranking of the most used database, as you can see, there is a lot of them!\nIntroduction to PostgreSQL\n\"PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active development on the core platform.\" (source: postgresql.org)\nWhat is SQL?\n\nPronounced S-Q-L or sequel\nStands for Structured Query Language\nSQL is the standard language used to communicate with relational database\nSQL statements are used to query, create, update, delete records in a database\nSQL statements are executed by a RDBMS.\n\nWhat is a RDBMS?\n\nStands for Relational Database Management System\nIt is a program that processes SQL statements to manage a relational database\nPostgreSQL is a RDBMS.\n\nWhat characterizes a relational database?\nAs mentioned previously, a relational database is a specific type of database. Data is stored in tables of rows and columns as per the example below:\n\n\n  \n\n\nHow about storing everything in one big table as shown below? Why isn't it a good idea?\nA customer could have several bookings. If the customer changes their telephone number, you would have to update every single rows for this customer with their new number, which is more prone to errors. As a general rule, try to avoid duplication of data, and instead design your system in a way that you have a single source of truth for each piece of data. The example below is NOT a good solution.\n\n\n  \n\n\nDatabase modeling exercise\nScenario: You've been hired to create a database for a new company which wants to revolutionize the hotel booking market. The first task you've been given is to model how the company would store its data in a database. Here are your requirements:\n\nThe company wants to store in the database all the hotels available on their website\nFor each hotel, the company wants to record the name and the number of rooms. Also each hotel can have several room types and each room type has a specific price.\nThe company also needs to store the information of customers who registered on their website with a name, an email and an address.\nCustomers need to be able to record their bank details which consist of an account number and a sort code. Each customer can register several bank accounts if they want.\nFinally, as customers can book a room in an hotel starting on a specific date for a specific number of nights, the company wants to store the bookings.\n\nWith mentors help, model the database for this company. In particular, show the different entities, fields and relationships between each entity.\nCheck your PostgreSQL installation\nOpen a terminal in your laptop and verify the command psql -V returns the version of PostgreSQL. In psql, you can type use the command help to show the help menu. Within the command prompt, you can enter SQL statements and run them against PostgreSQL. To quit psql, enter the command \\q.\nCommunicating with the database using SQL\nAll commands in the following need to be entered in a psql command prompt. However, sometimes it's easier to write the code in a file and then load the file with psql. For example, if you write your SQL code in a file called test.sql, you can then execute it with psql -d DATABASE_NAME -f test.sql.\nCreating a new database\nIn a terminal, create a new database named cyf_hotels with the following command:\ncreatedb cyf_hotels\n\nThen connect to your database with:\npsql cyf_hotels\n\nCreating a table\nData are stored in tables. Let's first create a customers table to hold the details of customers.\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n  id        SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  name      VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,\n  email     VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,\n  address   VARCHAR(120),\n  city      VARCHAR(30),\n  postcode  VARCHAR(12),\n  country   VARCHAR(20)\n);\n\nFew things to mention from the SQL statement above:\n\nSERIAL PRIMARY KEY defines the column id as a unique identifier for each row. Moreover, this identifier will automatically incremented every time data is inserted. id is called the primary key of the table customers.\nVARCHAR(20) defines the column to hold text data with a maximum length of 20 characters\nNOT NULL defines the column as not nullable, which means that you must set a value.\nOther useful types include INT, TEXT, BOOLEAN and DATE.\nThe database will reject any values which don't match the type.\n\nDBeaver, a SQL client software\nDBeaver is a SQL client software application and a database administration tool.\nIf you think create tables in the command line is a bit confusing to you, this is your solution.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nInstallation\nOverview\nDatabase Navigator\nSQL Editor\n\nExercise 1\n\nCreate the customers table in the cyf_hotels database.\nVerify that the table customers is created with the psql command \\dt which lists the existing tables, or update the list of tables using DBeaver.\nDisplay the table customers definition with the command \\d customers and verify that it matches what you expect, or use DBeaver\nCreate a new table hotels in the cyf_hotels database with the following columns: an id, a name, the number of rooms and the hotel postcode. Use the commands above to verify that the table is correctly created.\n\nNow that we have a table to store customers and a table to store hotels, we can create a table to hold the bookings of customers for an hotel with the checkin date and the number of nights they intend to stay:\nCREATE TABLE bookings (\n  id               SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  customer_id      INT REFERENCES customers(id),\n  hotel_id         INT REFERENCES hotels(id),\n  checkin_date     DATE NOT NULL,\n  nights           INT NOT NULL\n);\n\nIn the above, customer_id and hotel_id are called foreign keys as they reference an id from a different table. This set a very strong constraint as you will not be able to create a booking for a customer id which does not exist in the customers table!\nExercise 2\n\nCreate the table bookings in your cyf_hotels database and verify that it is correctly created.\n\nInserting data\nOnce your customers, hotels and bookings table are created, you can insert data with the following SQL statements:\nINSERT INTO customers (name, email, address, city, postcode, country) VALUES ('John Smith','j.smith@johnsmith.org','11 New Road','Liverpool','L10 2AB','UK');\nINSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ('Triple Point Hotel', 10, 'CM194JS');\nINSERT INTO bookings (customer_id, hotel_id, checkin_date, nights) VALUES (1, 1, '2019-10-01', 2);\n\nThe data you insert should be of the same type with your table definition. For example, the following insert statement will fail:\nINSERT INTO bookings (customer_id, hotel_id, checkin_date, nights) VALUES (1, 1, '2019-14-01', 2);\n\nExercise 3\n\nRun the 3 SQL statements above.\nInsert yourself in the customers table.\nInsert the following 3 hotels in the hotels table:\nThe Triple Point Hotel has 10 rooms, its postcode is CM194JS\nThe Royal Cosmos Hotel has 5 rooms, its postcode is TR209AX\nThe Pacific Petal Motel has 15 rooms, its postcode is BN180TG\n\n\nTry to insert a booking for a customer id which does not exist in the customers table (for example ID 100). What is happening and why?\n\nRetrieving data\nPreviously, you have inserted data in your tables. How do you make sure these data have been inserted correctly? The following SQL statement is used to request data from a specific table:\nSELECT * FROM customers;\n\nExercise 4\n\nUse the above SQL statement to display all the data inserted in the customers table.\nUse the above SQL statement to display all the data inserted in the hotels table.\nUse the above SQL statement to display all the data inserted in the bookings table.\n\nRetrieving data with conditions\nActually, the SELECT statement is very powerful and you will see you can request a lot of different things with it. Have you seen the * character in the SQL statement above? It means that you want to see the data for all the columns of the table. What if you want to only return specific columns? For example, to retrieve all customers name and address from the table customers:\nSELECT name,address FROM customers;\n\nSometimes, you want to retrieve only data which verify a specific condition. In this case, you can use a WHERE clause. For example, to retrieve all hotels having more than 7 rooms:\nSELECT * FROM hotels WHERE rooms > 7;\n\nTo retrieve the customer name and address with id 1:\nSELECT name,address FROM customers WHERE id = 1;\n\nTo retrieve all the bookings starting after 2019/10/01:\nSELECT * FROM bookings WHERE checkin_date > '2019/10/01';\n\nTo retrieve all the bookings starting after 2019/10/01 for a minimum of 2 nights:\nSELECT * FROM bookings WHERE checkin_date > '2019/10/01' AND nights >= 2;\n\nTo retrieve all the hotels with the postcode CM194JS or TR209AX:\nSELECT * FROM hotels WHERE postcode = 'CM194JS' OR postcode = 'TR209AX';\n\nExercise 5\n\nExecute the file cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql which will reset your existing tables and insert more data in the customers, hotels and bookings tables.

Such changes include renaming a table, adding/removing a column, changing the name of a column, changing the type of a column etc... The general syntax to perform these operations is:\nALTER TABLE table_name action;\n\nFor example, to add a new column to the existing customers table:\nALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN date_of_birth DATE;\n\nTo delete an existing column from the customers table:\nALTER TABLE customers DROP COLUMN date_of_birth;\n\nTo rename the table customers into clients:\nALTER TABLE customers RENAME TO clients;\n\nFor more examples, you can consult the following tutorial: Postgres alter table.\nExercise 1\n\nAdd a column date_of_birth of type DATE in the customers table.\nRename the column date_of_birth to birthdate in the customers table.\nDelete the column birthdate from the customers table\n\nDropping a table\nTo delete the table customers:\nDROP TABLE customers;\n\nExercise 2:\n\nCreate a new table test\nDrop the table test\n\nUpdating a row\nThe general construction to update a row is:\nUPDATE table SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;\n\nFor example, to update the name and country of the customers with ID 3:\nUPDATE customers SET name='Bob Marley', country='Jamaica' WHERE id=3;\n\nExercise 3\n\nUpdate the postcode of the hotel named Elder Lake Hotel to L10XYZ\nUpdate the number of rooms of Cozy Hotel to 25\nFor the customer named Nadia Sethuraman, update her address to 2 Blue Street, her city to Glasgow and her postcode to G11ABC in one query\nUpdate all the bookings of customer with ID 1 for the hotel with ID 1 to 5 nights in one query\n\nDeleting a row\nThe syntax to delete a row is:\nDELETE FROM table WHERE condition;\n\nFor example, to delete the booking with ID 4:\nDELETE FROM bookings WHERE id=4;\n\nNOTE: If you don't supply a WHERE clause with DELETE or UPDATE the command will be applied to all the rows in the table which is rarely what you want.\nExercise 4\n\nDelete the booking of customer ID 8 for the date 2020-01-03\nDelete all the bookings of customer ID 6\nDelete the customer with ID 6\n\nJoining tables\nSometimes, you will need to retrieve data which are spread in different tables in a single response. For this purpose, you will need to join tables together. The general syntax is:\nSELECT A.column1, B.column2 FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.b_id=B.id;\n\nFor example, to load all the bookings along with customer data:\nSELECT * FROM customers INNER JOIN bookings ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id;\n\nTo load all the bookings along with customer data and hotel data:\nSELECT * FROM bookings\nINNER JOIN customers ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id\nINNER JOIN hotels ON hotels.id=bookings.hotel_id;\n\nTo load the booking checkin dates for customer ID 1 along with the customer name and the hotel name:\nSELECT bookings.checkin_date,customers.name,hotels.name FROM bookings\nINNER JOIN customers ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id\nINNER JOIN hotels ON hotels.id=bookings.hotel_id\nWHERE customers.id=1;\n\nExercise 5\n\nTry and understand each of the queries above in your psql prompt\nRetrieve all the bookings along with customer data for bookings starting in 2020\nRetrieve the customer names, booking start dates and number of nights for all customers who booked the hotel name Jade Peaks Hotel\nRetrieve all the booking start dates with customer names and hotel names for all bookings for more than 5 nights\n\nOther useful operations\nOrdering the result:\nSELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column;\n\nThis will sort the returned rows in the ascending order for \"column\". To sort them in descending order, use:\nSELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column DESC;\n\nLimiting the number of results returned:\nSELECT * FROM table LIMIT 10;\n\nReturning all customers whose ID is 1, 2, 3 or 4:\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE id IN (1,2,3,4);\n\nQuery by pattern matching, for example retrieve all customers whose name starts with Bob:\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'Bob%';\n\nYou can combine different operations together, for example, if you want to retrieve all the booking start dates with the customer names and hotel names for customer names starting with the letter M ordered by hotel name with a limit of 3 results:\nSELECT bookings.checkin_date,customers.name,hotels.name FROM bookings\nINNER JOIN customers ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id\nINNER JOIN hotels ON hotels.id=bookings.hotel_id\nWHERE customers.name LIKE 'M%'\nORDER BY hotels.name\nLIMIT 3;\n\nExercise 6\n\nRetrieve all customers whose name starts with the letter S\nRetrieve all hotels which have the word Hotel in their name\nRetrieve the booking start date, customer name, hotel name for the top 5 bookings ordered by number of nights in descending order\n\nIntegration with NodeJS\nIntroduction to node-postgres\n\"node-postgres is a collection of node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database.\" - https://node-postgres.com/\nIn the following, we will use node-postgres to...\n\nConnect to a database\nSend SQL query to the database and get results\n\nLoading data from a database with a GET endpoint\nLet's build a brand new NodeJS application with a single GET endpoint to load the list of hotels that you already have in the hotels table of the cyf_hotels database.\nFirst, create a new NodeJS application that we will call cyf-hotels-api (enter server.js when asking about the entry point):\nmkdir cyf-hotels-api && cd cyf-hotels-api && npm init\nAs before, we will use the Express library to build our API, and the node-postgres library to connect with our database:\nnpm install --save express\nnpm install --save pg\nCreate a server.js file, import express, initialise the server and start listening for requests:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n    console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\nImport pg library and create a new GET endpoint to load the list of hotels:\nconst { Pool } = require('pg');\n\nconst pool = new Pool({\n    user: 'postgres',\n    host: 'localhost',\n    database: 'cyf_hotels',\n    password: '',\n    port: 5432\n});\n\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function(req, res) {\n    pool.query('SELECT * FROM hotels', (error, result) => {\n        res.json(result.rows);\n    });\n});\nIn the code above:\n\nWe first import the Pool class from the pg library, which is used to connect to a database\nWe create a new pool where we specify the credentials to connect to the cyf_hotels database\nWe then create a new /hotels endpoint where we use the method query() to send a SQL query to load all the hotels from the table hotels and return the results with result.rows. You can write any valid SQL query that you learned in the query() method!\n\nStart your server with node server.js and try to reach the /hotels endpoint to see the list of hotels currently available in your hotels table of your cyf_hotels database. You can try to create/update/delete hotels to verify that your API always returns what is stored in your database.\nHomework\nFork, clone and complete all of the tasks in Week 2 of the Database Homework repository.\n"},"db/week-3/lesson.html":{"url":"db/week-3/lesson.html","title":"Week 20 - SQL with NodeJS","keywords":"","body":"Database 3: More integration with NodeJS\n\nTeaching this lesson?\nRead the Mentors Notes here\n\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nRevision from last week\nRecap integration of cyf_hotels DB with NodeJS\nCRUD operations with NodeJS and PostgreSQL\nCreating data\nReading data\nUpdating data\nDeleting data\n\n\nHomework\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson students should be able to\n\nCreate an API endpoint that can add data to a database\nWrite code that effectively validates data before adding it to a database\nBe aware of the dangers of SQL injection attacks, and how to avoid them\nCreate an API endpoint that can retrieve data from a database with multiple parameters\nCreate an API endpoint that can update data in a database\nCreate an API endpoint that can delete data in a database\n\n\nRecap integration of cyf_hotels DB with NodeJS\nFor this class, we will use the tables and data from cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql. To start from a clean state for your cyf_hotels database, run psql -d cyf_hotels -f cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql.\nDuring the last class, we created a new NodeJS project called cyf-hotels-api with a single API endpoint /hotels to get the list of all hotels. In this class, we will add other endpoints with more functionalities to interact with the cyf_hotels database.\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst { Pool } = require(\"pg\");\n\nconst pool = new Pool({\n  user: \"postgres\",\n  host: \"localhost\",\n  database: \"cyf_hotels\",\n  password: \"\",\n  port: 5432,\n});\n\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function (req, res) {\n  pool\n    .query(\"SELECT * FROM hotels\")\n    .then((result) => res.json(result.rows))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\nCRUD operations with NodeJS and PostgreSQL\n\"The acronym CRUD refers to all of the major functions that are implemented in relational database applications. Each letter in the acronym can map to a standard Structured Query Language (SQL) statement and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method [...].\" - Wikipedia\n\n\n  \n\n\nCreating data\nIn the following, we will add a new API endpoint to create a new hotel in the table hotels of the cyf_hotels database. As a reminder, here is an example of a SQL insert statement to add a new hotel:\nINSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ('New Hotel', 5, 'ABC001');\n\nAs we create a new record in the database, we will add a new POST endpoint in the cyf-hotels-api project from last class. Moreover, we need to be able to pass some parameters to this API endpoint such as the hotel name, the number of rooms and the postcode, so we can use this API to create different hotel. These parameters can be sent in the body of the request. To access the parameters in the body of the request with Express.JS, we need to add the module body-parser to the cyf-hotels-api project:\nnpm install --save body-parser\nThen include it in the server.js:\nconst bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\nWe can finally add our new endpoint to create a new hotel:\napp.post(\"/hotels\", function (req, res) {\n  const newHotelName = req.body.name;\n  const newHotelRooms = req.body.rooms;\n  const newHotelPostcode = req.body.postcode;\n\n  const query =\n    \"INSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)\";\n\n  pool\n    .query(query, [newHotelName, newHotelRooms, newHotelPostcode])\n    .then(() => res.send(\"Hotel created!\"))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nWhat could go wrong with the code above? There is no validation of any user inputs which could result in errors, duplications or inconsistent data in the database! Here are few examples of things we can verify before creating the hotel in the database:\n\nCheck that the number of rooms is a positive number\nCheck that no hotel with the same name already exists in the database\n...\n\nLet's start by validating that the number of rooms is a positive number and if it doesn't, return an error.\nif (!Number.isInteger(newHotelRooms) || newHotelRooms \nThen we can validate the new hotel doesn't already exist in the database, thus preventing duplicate data.\napp.post(\"/hotels\", function (req, res) {\n  const newHotelName = req.body.name;\n  const newHotelRooms = req.body.rooms;\n  const newHotelPostcode = req.body.postcode;\n\n  if (!Number.isInteger(newHotelRooms) || newHotelRooms  {\n      if (result.rows.length > 0) {\n        return res\n          .status(400)\n          .send(\"An hotel with the same name already exists!\");\n      } else {\n        const query =\n          \"INSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)\";\n        pool\n          .query(query, [newHotelName, newHotelRooms, newHotelPostcode])\n          .then(() => res.send(\"Hotel created!\"))\n          .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n      }\n    });\n});\n\nExercise 1\n\nFollow the above steps to create a new POST endpoint /hotels to create a new hotel. Make sure to add validation for the number of rooms and the hotel name. Test your new API endpoint with Postman and check that the new hotel has been correctly created in your database.\nAdd a new POST API endpoint to create a new customer in the customers table.\nAdd validation to check that there is no other customer with the same name in the customers table before creating a new customer.\n\nReading data\nWe already have one GET endpoint to load all the hotels in the database. However, we can improve this endpoint and add a couple of extra functionalities. First, we may want to order the list of hotels by name:\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function (req, res) {\n  pool\n    .query(\"SELECT * FROM hotels ORDER BY name\")\n    .then((result) => res.json(result.rows))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nAnother functionality which could be useful is to filter the hotel with a keyword to be able to search for a specific hotel name:\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function (req, res) {\n  const hotelNameQuery = req.query.name;\n  let query = `SELECT * FROM hotels ORDER BY name`;\n\n  if (hotelNameQuery) {\n    query = `SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE name LIKE '%${hotelNameQuery}%' ORDER BY name`;\n  }\n\n  pool\n    .query(query)\n    .then((result) => res.json(result.rows))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nIn some case, you would want to load only a specific hotel by id. Let's define a new GET endpoint to load one specific hotel:\napp.get(\"/hotels/:hotelId\", function (req, res) {\n  const hotelId = req.params.hotelId;\n\n  pool\n    .query(\"SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE id=$1\", [hotelId])\n    .then((result) => res.json(result.rows))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nExercise 2\n\nAdd the GET endpoints /hotels and /hotels/:hotelId mentioned above and try to use these endpoints with Postman.\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers to load all customers ordered by name.\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers/:customerId to load one customer by ID.\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers/:customerId/bookings to load all the bookings of a specific customer. Returns the following information: check in date, number of nights, hotel name, hotel postcode.\n\nUpdating data\nWe can now implement an endpoint to update a customer record in the database. For this, we will use a PUT endpoint.\napp.put(\"/customers/:customerId\", function (req, res) {\n  const customerId = req.params.customerId;\n  const newEmail = req.body.email;\n\n  pool\n    .query(\"UPDATE customers SET email=$1 WHERE id=$2\", [newEmail, customerId])\n    .then(() => res.send(`Customer ${customerId} updated!`))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nWhat can go wrong in the code above? Again, there is no validation! We could set an empty email or even a string which is not following the format of an email. Remember, validating data is very important to make sure you don't end up with inconsistent data in your database!\nExercise 3\n\nAdd the PUT endpoint /customers/:customerId and verify you can update a customer email using Postman.\nAdd validation for the email before updating the customer record in the database. If the email is empty, return an error message.\nAdd the possibility to also update the address, the city, the postcode and the country of a customer. Be aware that if you want to update the city only for example, the other fields should not be changed!\n\nDeleting data\nTo delete a record from the database, we will use a DELETE endpoint:\napp.delete(\"/customers/:customerId\", function (req, res) {\n  const customerId = req.params.customerId;\n\n  pool\n    .query(\"DELETE FROM customers WHERE id=$1\", [customerId])\n    .then(() => res.send(`Customer ${customerId} deleted!`))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nHowever, if you try to delete a customer which already has some bookings, the previous endpoint will fail. Do you know why? You cannot delete a customer whose ID is used as a foreign key in another table (in this case, in the bookings table). Let's delete all the customer bookings first:\napp.delete(\"/customers/:customerId\", function (req, res) {\n  const customerId = req.params.customerId;\n\n  pool\n    .query(\"DELETE FROM bookings WHERE customer_id=$1\", [customerId])\n    .then(() => {\n      pool\n        .query(\"DELETE FROM customers WHERE id=$1\", [customerId])\n        .then(() => res.send(`Customer ${customerId} deleted!`))\n        .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n    })\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nExercise 4\n\nAdd the DELETE endpoint /customers/:customerId above and verify you can delete a customer along their bookings with Postman.\nAdd a new DELETE endpoint /hotels/:hotelId to delete a specific hotel. A hotel can only be deleted if it doesn't appear in any of the customers' bookings! Make sure you add the corresponding validation before you try to delete a hotel.\n\nHomework\nYou should complete all of the tasks in Week 3 of the Database Homework repository.\n"},"db/week-4/lesson.html":{"url":"db/week-4/lesson.html","title":"Week 21 - NodeJS Workshop","keywords":"","body":"Node - Week 3\n\nTeaching this lesson?\nRead the Mentors Notes here\n\nContents\n\nNode Recap\nAuthentication\nSecurity\nBest Practices\nLogin Workshop\n\n\nNode Recap\nJavascript has evolved from the browser to be used in the backend. It does not need a framework as we saw in week-13, however a framework like Express allows us to develop faster.\nDocumentation\nWhen you are working with frameworks it is always helpful to use their documentation.\n\nExpress Documentation\nNode.js Documentation\n\nMiddleware\nMiddleware allow us to process requests to add functionalities that are not built in to Express, for example logging, authentication, etc.\n\n\nExpress Documentation: Using Middleware\nVideo: body-parser which makes it easier to work with POST requests and forms.\n\n\nAuthentication\nRouting refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to the client requests. These are configured differently for each framework, and can range from basic configuration to very extensive for more complex use cases.\nSimple example\napp.get(\"/\", function (request, response) {\n  res.send(\"hello world\");\n});\n\nSometimes you need to add user functionality for your website. Example using express-session for authentication\napp.get('/', (request, response) => {\n    if (request.session.loggedin) {\n        response.send('Welcome back, ' + request.session.username + '!');\n    } else {\n        response.send('Please login to view this page!');\n    }\n    response.end();\n});\n\nTo understand express-session, we need to know first, what is a session and a cookie?\n\nSession: is a single interval of time in which the user is authenticated.\nCookie: are used to collect identifying information about the user, such as Web surfing behavior or user preferences for a specific Web site, also are used to store user sessions. Depending on the management, Cookies are stored during a specified period of time, in the browser or in the hard drive\n\n\n\nRead the Basics on Authentication to understand better the process.\n\n\nExercise 1: Create a server with the following code.

If you\nfind that you're writing a lot of comments, then it's a good indicator that\nyour code is too verbose and potentially overengineered\n\n\n\nJavaScript\n\nVariable and function names should be descriptive\n\nE.g. const actors = getActorsFromFilm(film); is easier to understand than\nconst temp2 = doStuff(temp);\n\n\nKeep functions as short as possible\n\nIf a function is longer than 15 lines, consider breaking it down into\nsmaller functions\n\n\nUse variables if a literal value is repeated more than once\n\nE.g. console.log('Peter', 'Peter'.length); -> const name = 'Peter';\nconsole.log(name, name.length);\n\n\n\nCSS\n\nStyles should be based upon class selectors where possible e.g. .some-class\n\nFacilitates reuse\n\n\nDon't use ID-based selectors e.g. #some-id\n\nAvoid styling HTML element selectors directly, unless it's to remove default\nbrowser styling\n\nAvoid using style properties in JavaScript\n\nE.g. myElement.style.display = 'none';\nThis results in styles that are difficult to reuse\nUse Element.prototype.classList instead e.g.\nmyElement.classList.add('hidden');\n\n\n\nGit\n\nMake small, frequent commits\n\nIf you make a mistake, then it's easier to revert than if you only make\nlarge, occasional commits\n\n\nAvoid committing commented-out code\n\nIf the code exists in a previous commit, then use GitHub or git diff to\nview it\n\n\n\n"},"others/career-development.html":{"url":"others/career-development.html","title":"Career Development","keywords":"","body":"Career Development\nCV\nBest practice\n\nKeep it short and concise, 1-2 pages maximum\nPut your details at the top.

These are other git repositories that can be connected to over the internet. You can push or pull code changes from them. Remotes have a name and a URL. \nAll the remotes that you will use at Migracode are hosted on GitHub, so have a github.com URL.\nWhen you clone a repo from GitHub, the default remote is named origin and the URL is set to that of the GitHub repo.\nYou can view the remotes you have set up with:\ngit remote -v\nBasic Git commands\nIf you are working with the terminal, before execute the commands, are you in the right repository folder? We can have different folders, each one for a different repository.\nConfiguration commands:\n\ngit config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\ngit config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\ngit config --list\n\nCommands to create a project:\n\ngit init *project name*  //initialize GIT repository in an empty directory (locally)\ngit add . //track changes on files (create, remove, modify)\ngit commit -m “message” //save changes\ngit remote add origin *https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo*\ngit push -u origin master //upload origin (my laptop) to the server in branch \ngit status //show current status\ngit clone *url* //download files from URL with a file .git\n\nAdvanced\nGit Branching and merging\nGit Branching\nYou have been using git to track the changes you make to your exercises project. Each time you commit, you save a copy of your files.\n\nWhen you create a new branch, you create a separate line of commits.\n\nWith branches, you can work on two copies of your project and switch back and forth.\n\nComplete exercise 9 from the exercise project to learn how to use git branches.\n\nIf you want to go deeper, read this article on how git branching works.\n\nGit Merging\nLast week you used Git to create a branch so that you could work on two different copies of your project at the same time.\n\nThis week you will learn how to merge your changes in one branch back to your master branch.\n\nComplete exercise 18 from the exercise project.\nGit Merge Conflicts\nLast week you used Git to merge your changes from one branch back into your master branch.\n\nSometimes Git can not automatically merge one branch into another, because each branch has modified the same line of code. Git does not know which version of the line is the correct one. When this happens, we have a \"merge conflict\".\n\nAs a developer, you have to tell Git which version of the line of code is correct.\nComplete exercise 28 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises to learn how to resolve a merge conflict.\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts\nGit Conflicts\nAs a professional, you'll usually need to work alongside other coders to build an app or website. We use version control to coordinate changes and manage any conflicts that arise. Git is a version control system which helps us merge code that we've been working on separately into one common codebase.\nTo manage conflicts, we will need a common code base in which all changes are coordinated. When working on our own, we'll make our changes in branches to keep the code separate. Then we'll learn how to refresh your individual branch with the common code base, and prepare your changes to be merged.\n\nExercise: Get together in pairs and select a \"leader\". The leader should fork this repository to their GitHub account. The other person should then fork the leader's repository. Both students should then clone their own personal forks locally.\n\nNow that you have the project set up on your computer, you need a place to safely make changes without effecting the common code base. To do this, we'll navigate to our project in the Terminal and create a new branch:\ncd \ngit checkout -b my-first-branch\n\nWhen you commit changes on this branch, your changes will be saved separately from the common code base. This way both team members can make changes at the same time.\n\nExercise: Add your name and a sentence about yourself to the index.html file. Then git add and git commit to commit to your personal branch.\n\nNow you have two branches: master and my-first-branch. These branches have diverged, which means you have changes in one that don't appear in the other. You can check this by running git checkout master, then looking at your index.html file.\nWhen you're done, run git checkout my-first-branch to go back to the branch with your changes. Git saves your changes in both branches and lets you switch between them. That's why we call it \"version control\". It saves different versions so you can switch between them.\nRight now, your new branch only exists on your computer. Let's push it up to GitHub so you can see it in your profile.\ngit checkout my-first-branch\ngit push -u origin my-first-branch\n\nNow both students in each pair, the \"leader\" and the other student, should have branches with changes. Now let's try to merge these changes together into the \"leader's\" master branch.\n\nExercise: Browse to the \"leader's\" GitHub repository and open a new Pull Request. The Pull Request should ask to merge your my-first-branch branch into the \"leader's\" master branch. Ask a mentor for help if you have trouble figuring out how to issue a Pull Request. When both students have issued a Pull Request to the correct place, merge one of them but not the other.\n\nCongrats, you've merged one student's changes with the common code base in the master branch. If you check the other Pull Request, you'll see you have a problem. It can't be merged automatically because there's a conflict. Why?\nConflicts emerge whenever the same file has been edited, and git can't determine what changes should be kept and what changes should be discarded. A human -- that's you -- needs to step in and sort it out. To help us, git writes into our code so we can see where it is confused. Here's an example of a merge conflict in our code:\nMozafar\n+   I am a mentor at CodeYourFuture.\n=======\n-   Daniel\n-   I like to ride bikes\n>>>>>>> my-first-branch\n\nTo resolve a conflict, we decide which lines to keep and which lines to remove. When we're done, we remove the extra lines that git added (, ======== and >>>>>>>).\nLet's see how we can resolve this conflict with your branches. First we need to fetch the latest changes from the leader's master branch. If you're the leader, just do:\ngit checkout master\ngit pull\n\nIf you're the other student, you need to set up the remote and pull from that master:\ngit checkout master\ngit remote add upstream \ngit pull upstream master\n\nNow everyone's master branch should include the Pull Request that was merged. Whichever student still needs to get their Pull Request merged can bring those changes into their branch like this:\ngit checkout my-first-branch\ngit merge master\n\nYou probably received a merge conflict.\n\nExercise: Follow the steps we discussed before about how to resolve a merge conflict by editing the file. Make sure both students changes are included in the final version. When you're done, use git add, git commit and git push to share your changes with GitHub. If everything has gone correctly, you can now merge the Pull Request.\n\nNow everyone can sync their changes. If you're the leader, just do:\ngit checkout master\ngit pull\n\nIf you're the other student, do this:\ngit checkout master\ngit pull upstream master\n\n\nExercise: As a group, discuss why the git pull command is different for the leader and the other student.\nExercise: Try to do the pull requests again, but this time switch the pull requests so that the other student must manage the merge conflict.\n\nIf you're feeling confused, don't worry. Version control is one of the most difficult things you'll learn and we'll be going over it again and again and again.\nMerging and advanced Git commands\n\ngit fetch //fetch latest changes from origin and all branches (no merge)\ngit pull  //fetch latest changes from origin and all branches (with merge)\ngit merge\n\nBranches:\n\ngit branch test //creates a new local branch\ngit checkout test //move to branch test\ngit checkout master //move to branch master\ngit checkout -b test //create a new local branch and move into it\ngit push origin test //push the branch and all commits to the server\ngit branch -d test //remove a local branch\ngit checkout -b test origin/test\ngit fetch --all   //to get all branches from server\n\nMaking a Pull Request\nAdding a Remote\nFollow these instructions if you are getting an permission error when pushing your changes. If you have cloned the original repo before forking, you'll need to follow these instructions. You can check this by running git remote -v. If the output looks something like:\norigin git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/css-skin.git (fetch)\norigin git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/css-skin.git (push)\nthen you have cloned before forking. The key is that the origin remote is pointing to a CodeYourFuture URL. Don't worry, we can fix it!\nThe first step is to fork the original repo. Follow the first 2 steps from forking instructions above.\nNow, instead of cloning the fork (you have already cloned), you need to add it as a remote.\nRun:\ngit remote add fork URL_YOU_COPIED_FROM_FORK\nThis will add a new remote called fork that points to your new fork. To check this, run git remote -v again. You should see both the origin and fork remotes.\nNow that you have your fork remote you can push to it (instead of the origin remote, which will error) by running:\ngit push fork\nYou'll need to remember to add the fork every time you push.\nCreating a PR\nSo you've done your homework, you've committed your changes and are ready to make a PR. Congrats! &#x1F389;&#x1F389;&#x1F389;\nAt this point you should have followed the instructions either to fork the original repo or added a remote to your fork. If you haven't make sure you read those sections first.\nYou will need to push to your fork. If you forked and then cloned (as in the how to fork instructions) then you just need to run git push. If you added a remote to your fork, then you will need to run git push fork.\nNext you need to go the original repo in your browser (probably starting with https://github.com/CodeYourFuture). Next click the Pull Requests tab:\n\nThen click the New pull request button:\n\nThen click the \"compare across forks\" link:\n\nThen click the \"head fork\" dropdown button:\n\nThen find your fork in the list and click it:\n\nThen click the Create pull request button:\n\nAlmost there! Now fill out the PR form. Give it a sensible title and an (optional) description:\n\nAnd finally click the Create pull request button at the bottom of the form:\n\nThat's it! You created your PR!\n\nCreating a pull request from a fork\nGit in the final projects\nIn the final projects you will have to manage a Git repository to work all the Team toghether, there are many ways to do it, but these are our recommendations:\n\nSeparate front-end and back-end code: Create one repository for the back-end code and another one for the front-end code, or in the same repository create a folder for the back-end and a different folder for the front-end, but take into account to manage the folders and package.json properly without breaking others work\nOne Team, One Repo: Create the repositories in the account of one member of the team, and grant the others students to work there. The other members should clone directly the repository, DO NOT FORK IT! if you fork it every member of the team will work in an independent reposotory adding difficulties to manage merges of work\nTo give push privileges to other team members, go to your repository in GitHub,  and click Settings->Manage access -> Invite a collaborator\n\n\nUse a Git strategy: once you divide your work in different functionalities and are assigned to team members, to reduce the number of merges and do not involve everybody in the common files, you should have a strategy to work\nAssign a Git Release Manager: Assign a member of the team that knows all the code structure and will be the best member to join all functionalities together. The Migracode Team and mentors will help this member to solve conflicts and manage the versions of the project.\nUse gitignore: Check this link\n\nSmall Teams Git strategy\nThere are strategies with more branches and more structurated, like the common strategy in companies, but taking into account number of people, the criticallity of our software and to not spend many hours merging. We recommend you this strategy for the final project!\n\n3 type of branches: master, develop and developers branches\n2 user roles: Release Manager and Developer\n\n\nBranches:\n\nmaster: The master branch stores the official release history, the versions that we will show to the client or to the class after each sprint.\ndevelop: The develop branch serves as an integration branch for features. Once develop has acquired enough features for a release, those will be tested before merge it with master.\ndeveloper branches: Each new developer has a branch with their name, as dev-john or john. developer branches are created from develop and the developer will always work there.\n\nRoles:\n\nRelease Manager: is the one that manages master and develop. This user, that at the same time is a Developer, do all merges between developers branches and develop. Also is the one that creates versions in master.\nDeveloper: all the members on the team are developeres, they develop the assigned features in the branch.\n\nActions and commands\nFirst steps:\nCreate the repositories (Release Manager):\n\nCreate and add write and push privileges to all developers\nCreate a new branch develop from master:\ngit checkout master be sure you are on master branch\ngit checkout -b develop Create the branch develop from master\ngit push -u origin develop Push the local branch to remote, so it is published on Github and other members can see it\n\n\nCreate a new branch for each developer from develop:\ngit checkout -b dev_john\ngit push -u origin develop\n\n\n\nMove to working repositories (all developers):\n\nEach developer should get the new branches from remote and move to the assigned branch:\ngit fetch --all Get all new branches created\ngit checkout dev_john Move yo your name branch\n\n\n\nDaily work:\n\nAll developers should commit and push all your work\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"new feature\"\ngit push\n\n\n\nEnd of a sprint:\nCreate the sprint version (Release Manager):\n\ngit checkout develop\ngit fetch --all\nMerge develop branch with the branch of each developer\ngit merge dev_john\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"merge with john\"\ngit push\n\n\nCheck that all functionalities are working together, have a meeting to check the version and fix all integration or merge problems\nAs a closed version, move the code to master:\ngit checkout master\ngit merge develop\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"merge with john\"\ngit push\n\n\nGo back to your working branch\ngit checkout dev_me\n\n\n\nUpdate your working branches with last version (all developers)\n\ngit fetch --all to get last version of all branches\ngit merge develop\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"merge with develop\"\ngit push\n\nMain companies Git strategy\nHere you can find an example on how to manage planified and unplanified (with bugs) versions of a software. More information\n\n\nmaster: The master branch stores the official release history, for each published version a tag is assigned with a version number\nhotfix: is the branch we use to fix bugs from the published version as soon as possible, without adding new features. As we can see in v0.1 version the software has a bug, we fix it in the Hotfix branch, and then we merge it directly with master. Also this change is added to develop brach for future versions.\nrelease-xxx: release branches are created from develop, to have a version that should be tested in detail to become  a new version, if during the test some bugs are found are fix directly in this branch. xxx is the name o the release\ndevelop: The develop branch serves as an integration branch for features. Once develop has acquired enough features for a release, a new release branch is created to test it before go to master.\nfeature-xxx: Each new feature with name xxx, should reside in its own branch. But, instead of branching off of master, feature branches use develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact directly with master.\n\n"},"others/coding-101.html":{"url":"others/coding-101.html","title":"Coding 101","keywords":"","body":"\nCoding 101\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nWhat is a computer program?\nGetting started with JavaScript\n\nWhat is a computer program?\n\nIntro to programming logic – Making a sandwich (Source:\nhttp://static.zerorobotics.mit.edu/docs/team-activities/ProgrammingPeanutButterAndJelly.pdf)\n\n\nAsk the students what they think a program is at its most basic level\nGuide, if necessary, towards the idea that its instructions or an action\netc.\n\n\nFocus on the idea of instructions:\nExplain that like with a physical activity - tools and steps are required\nto carry out instructions\nIntroduce the group activity of programming the activity of making a\nsandwich\n\n\nAsk the students what items we will need to make a sandwich:\nAs they shout them out list them on the screen for the whole class to see\nIntroduce the concept of objects and classes.

Explain the benefits of well named methods in\nprogramming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.\n\nGetting started with JavaScript\nWe will spend most of this lesson in Codepen. To get started, go to\ncodepen.io/pen/ to create a new Pen. On the bottom left,\nclick the \"Console\" button to open the console.\n\nYou can place your cursor right behind the > sign. Type a simple expression,\nsuch as 2 + 2 and hit enter. You will see expression, as well as its result,\nin the window above.\n\nYou will be able to follow most of this session along just entering expressions\nin the console like this.\nVariables and assignments\nFor an expression or a value to be of any use to us, we need to store it in a\nvariable.\nVariables have a name (identifier) that we can use to refer to a value. You\ncan assign a value to a variable with the following statement:\nvar x = 3;\n^   ^ ^ ^\n|   | | value\n|   | assignment operator\n|   identifier\ndeclaration statement\nLet’s break this statement down:\n\nvar: With the var statement we tell the JavaScript engine that x is now\na variable\nx: The variable name/identifier. It can be short or long, but must not\ncontain spaces and must not start with a number.\n=: The equal sign is the assigmnent operator\n3: The value that we assign to the variable. This can be any number, string\nor boolean, or any more complex data type that we will introduce later. You\ncan also use an existing variable here.\n;: THe semicolon is not strictly needed, but is generally used to terminate\na statement.\n\nNow you can use the identifier instead of the actual value in an expression:\nx + x, x * x, console.log(x)\nSimple data types & Expressions\nNumbers\nLet’s start with something seemingly simple - numbers. Here are some:\n1;\n15;\n3195803798;\n1.4;\n0.0000005;\n0 - 23;\n\nYou will see that there are whole numbers (no decimal point) and real numbers\n(decimal point), which in JavaScript are so-called “floating point” numbers.\nNumbers can be positive or negative and they support all the basic math\noperators that you would expect:\n2 + 2; // 4\n2 - 5; // -3\n2 * 3; // 6\n10 / 2; // 5\n3 * -2; // -6\n\nOperators have the same precedence as in algebra: * and / have higher\nprecedence than + and -.\n\nTODO: Do math exercise\nTODO: What about Infinity, Math.PI, IEEE floating point bullshit, NaN\n\nStrings\nStrings represent any sort of text. They are delimited by single quotes (') or\ndouble quotes (”) and can be of any length.\n'' // empty string\n\"\" // empty string\n'Hello'\n'I am learning JavaScript'\n'It\\'s been a great journey so far!'\n\"Double quotes work as well\"\n\nIf you need single or double quotes inside the string, you need to “escape”\nthem by putting a backslash in front of them. If you don’t do this, the\nJavaScript engine will think the string ends here, because it encounters a\nquote.\n\nThe most common operation on strings is to append one string to another. This is\ncalled string concatenation. It’s achieved by the plus (+) operator:\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" // \"HelloWorld\"\n\nTODO: Introduce string concatenation\nTODO: What about basic string functions, like substr, replace etc?\n\nBooleans\nBooleans are a data type that\ncan only have two values: true and false.\nLike numbers, they can be combined using operators, but there are different\noperators for booleans (analoguous to\nBoolean algebra). The most\nimportant ones are:\n\n!

Follow the instructions for\nyour platform (Windows, Linux or OS X).\nAlso download and install RoboMongo from https://robomongo.org/download.\nOpen two instances of terminal. Run mongod - this will start MongoDB then run\nmongo on the other window.\n\nIn the mongo shell (terminal) - run the command version() and you should get\nthe version of Mongo printed on the terminal\nDatabases overview\n\nDiscussion:\n\nWhat is a database role?\nWhy do we need a database? Why not just use the file system?\nWhat would make a good database?\n\n\nWhy a database?\n\nDatabases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up\nlittle space).\nYou can have strucutre on your data\nYou can query for data in a database, you can sort data, add/edit/delete data\nYou can optimise a database to make searches (queries) quicker\nYou can relate pieces of data to each other to avoid duplication which makes\nyour information more reliable and less prone to errors\nACID\nIn computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is\na set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity\neven in the event of errors, power failures, etc.\n\n\nDatabases can handle very large data sets.\nDatabases are concurrent; multiple users can use them at the same time without\ncorrupting the data.\nDatabases scale well\n\nRelational and non-relational databases\nThere are mainly two flavours of databases used commercially these days.\nRelational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.\nRelational databases include MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle\nDatabase and many others. They've been around for a long time and they're used\nfor all kind of applications.\nNon-relational databases are relatively new and they include the likes of\nMongoDB, Casandra, Neo4j etc...\nMongo\n\nMongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database\nprogram. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like\ndocuments.\n\nBSON (JSON-like document)\nIn a Relational database, information is organised in rows in tables with\npredefined columns.\nIn a non-relational database, information is organised in documents. MongoDB\nstores data records in a format similar to JSON called BSON. BSON is a binary\nrepresentation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.\n\nLet's look at this database table Students containing information about\nstudents participating in a course \n\nExercise: What are the columns, rows and tables?\n\n\n\nExercise: Open https://jsonlint.com/ and write a JSON representation of two\nrows in the Students table example. Click Validate JSON and make sure the\ndocument is valid.\n\nAre there any alternative representations you can think of?\n\n\nBSON is very similar to JSON. It contains more data types than JSON, it also\nallows the field names to not be quoted. Read more information about the\nformat - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/.\nMongo Shell\nLet's go to mongo shell and start interacting with our database system.\n1. create a database\nOn the shell, type the command use profile The shell should respond with\nswitched to db profile. At this stage, the database does not necessarily\nexist once we start adding information (collections) then the database will be\ncreated and the collection added to them.\nTo check the current database, run db.\n2. create a collection\nNow let's create our first collection. Make sure you're using the profile\ndatabase. Run db and it should print profile on the terminal.\nWe will insert a simple document representing a student.\n\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Habiiba', country: 'Somalia', assignedMentors:\n['Ashleigh'] })\n\nYou should get a confirmation with the number of records inserted.\nYou can also insert more than one document at a time. Run this command\n\ndb.students.insertMany([{ name: 'Khalid', country: 'Yemen' }, { name:\n'Yohannes', country: 'Ethiopia', assignedMentors: ['Michael'] }])\n\nrun the command db.students.count() and you should get that you have 3\ndocuments.\n3. Querying data\nQuerying is one of the most important reasons that we use databases. SQL is the\nlanguage used for querying relational databases, In MongoDB, we can use the\nmethod db.collection.find, passing a query in the form of a JSON object as a\nfirst parameter.\nLet's try few queries:\nGet all the students from Ethiopia.\n\ndb.students.find({country: 'Ethiopia'})\n\nWe can also provide an extra parameter projection to define what fields we\nwant back from the query.\nFor example, if we're only interested in the name\ndb.students.find({ country: \"Ethiopia\" }, { name: 1 });\n// you can also use { name: true }\n\nLet's add another two students to the collection\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Sudan', assignedMentors:\n['Michael'] })\nand\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Syria', assignedMentors:\n['Michael', 'Ashleigh'] })\nNow let's query for all the students that have Michael as mentor.\ndb.students.find({ assignedMentors: [\"Michael\"] });\n\nWhat if we want to find any student whose name is \"Mohamed\" AND whose country is\n\"Sudan\". You can then use the logical query operator $and.\ndb.students.find({\n  $and: [{ name: \"Mohamed\" }, { country: \"Sudan\" }]\n});\n\nNotice that name and country are case-sensitive.\nExercise:\n\nFind all students for whom Ashleigh is an assigned mentor.\nFind all students that have Michael as their only mentor\nFind students whose name is Mohamed OR Michael is their only mentor\nRead about the\n$in operator\nand use it to find students whose country is either Sudan or Ethiopia.\nLook at the other\nComparison Query Operators\nand the\nLogical Query Operators\nand use few of them.\n\nKey Concepts so far\nIn Mongo, a database contains collections that contain BSON\ndocuments. We can use the mongo shell to interact with our Mongo\ndatabases. The query documents are used to specify a selection filter using\nquery operators\nto search for documents in the collections.\n\nCheckpoint: Do you understand all the words highlighed in the last paragraph?\n\nNode with Mongo\nSo far we've been connecting to Mongo using the Mongo shell. Mongo has drivers\nfor most major programming languages but it's especially popular with NodeJS\napplications as its API and Query model is very close to JavaScript syntax and\npatterns.\nLet's start wiring Node with MongoDB as a datastore.\n\nFork and Clone the project\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop.\nrun npm install then npm run dev to run the application with autoreload -\nGo to the browser and make sure it's up and running.\n\nInstall the MongoDB Node.js Driver npm install mongodb --save\n\nLet's add an endpoint api/students that returns a json containing all the\nstudents that we've been saving to the database from the shell.\n\n\nGo to the file controllers/apiController, on top of the file, require the\nmodule\nconst MongoClient = require(\"mongodb\").MongoClient;\n\nthen add an endpoint for /students\nrouter.get(\"/students\", (req, res) => {\n  const mongoConnection = \"mongodb://localhost:27017/profile\";\n\n  MongoClient.connect(mongoConnection, (err, db) => {\n    const cursor = db.collection(\"students\").find({});\n    cursor.toArray((error, students) => {\n      db.close();\n      res.json(students);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nGo to your browser /api/students and you should see a JSON containing the\ndocuments we've added to the students collection earlier.\n\nExercise: Let's step through the previous code and understand it line by line.\n\nWhat is a Mongo conection string?\n\n\n[Connection String documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/) - The connection string follows this format: `mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]` - what parts do you have in our connection string right now?\nExercise\nNow let's change the api/posts to also use the mongo database instead of the\njson file under /data.\n\nFirst step is to save the posts in the database. Similar to what we did\nwith students collection, use the Mongo shell to create a new collection\ncalled posts and use insertMany to insert all the documents.\n\nChange the endpoint /api/posts to read its contents from the database (very\nsimilar code to what we wrote in /api/students endpoint). Go to\nhttp://localhost:3000/api/posts and make sure you see the posts. Update a\ndocument in the database (either check the documentation for\nupdate\nor use RoboMongo) and see if it gets reflected.\n\nOnce you have the endpoint running, delete the json data/posts.json.\n\nNow if you go to the root of your application http://localhost:3000, you\nwill encounter an error as it will still try to read from the file system but\nwe deleted the file. Update the / endpoint to also get the Posts from the\ndatabase.\n\n\nExercise Part 2: Refactor the code\nEven though our code does what's supposed to do, it has several issues. We have\na lot of duplicate code - both endpoints GET /api/posts and GET / do the\nsame call to the database and then do something with it. It's only that\nsomething (the callback) that is different so let's refactor the code to\neliminate duplication (DRY).\n\nThe variable mongoConnection is declared multiple times, that means that if\nthe connection string changes then we need to change multiple places causing\npossibilities of missing one instance and causing errors. Let's declare it\nonce and use it in the rest of the app.\n\nWhy is it bad to have duplicate code?\n\nExtract the Mongo calls to seperate functions. Extract the route for\n/api/students into a function named getStudents\n\nWhat will the function signature be?\n\nRemember the Single Responsibility Principle - the route handlers have\nmultiple responsibilities right now: Connecting to Mongo, getting the data\nthen sending it back as a response.\n\nMove the new function to a new file called helpers/db-client.js, export the\nfunctions and use them in the original file.\n\nDo you remember how we create modules and use them? module.exports and\nrequire.\n\nDo the same for the /posts\n\n\nExercise Part 3: Deploy our app\nLet's deploy our Database-Driven Application to Heroku. If you don't remember\nthe steps, refresh your memory from\nthe previous lesson.\nOnce you're finsihed, Go to your application on heroku and see if it is working\nproperly.\nIt should not be working.\nCan you have a guess on what went wrong? To see what's happening on the heroku\nserver, run heroku logs from the terminal and check the logs.\nMongo on Heroku\nHeroku, AWS and other cloud services allows us to use databases and other\nservices on the cloud without having to maintain physical servers making it easy\nto scale, monitor costs and build good solutions in general.\nWe've already used DynamoDB on AWS. This week, we'll do MongoDB.\n\nGo to Heroku dashboard\nhttps://dashboard.heroku.com\n\nClick on your app name in the dashboard. Go to Resources, under addons,\nsearch for mLab MongoDB and choose it. When you're prompted with this\nscreen - click on Provision.\n\n\n\nThe new MongoDB service will appear under Resources - you can click on it and it\nwill take you to a web interface to administer your MongoDB instance.\n\nGo to the Settings and click on Reveal Config Vars. You should see the\na variable called MongoDB_URI - that is the connection string for the MongoDB\ninstance on Heroku (on mLab used by Heroku).\n\n\nSo how can we use this connection string instead of our local one?\n\nEnvironment variables\nIn NodeJS, The process.env property returns an object containing the user\nenvironment. Environment variables allow us to configure different aspects of\nour application based on the environment where it's running - so for instance,\nwhen we run our application locally, we want to connect to the local MongoDB but\non Heroku, we want to connect to a different one.\nConnection strings are typically saved and used as Environment variables, other\ntypical uses are with passwords, secrets, URLs of other services etc... Anything\nthat is environment specific and that shouldn't live in the source code.\n\nSecurity tip: Never add passwords, connection strings or any sensitive\ninformation in your source code, always use an Environment variable.\n\nServices like Heroku and AWS can then use these environment variables to\nconfigure aspects of the application.\n\nWe've already used one Environment variable for Heroku before - what was it?\nExercise: Use the environment MongoDB_URI to connect to MongoDB on Heroku,\nbut fallback to localhost connection string if there is no environment\nvariable provided.\n\n\nCommit and push the changes to Heroku and see if it works.\n\nHomework\nRefer to the MongoDB/Node workshop for the Homework tasks -\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop\n\nRead https://www.upguard.com/articles/mysql-vs-mongodb\n\nResources\n\nWhy use a database\nDatabases and Collections\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/\nDocuments in MongoDB - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/\nPractice on a web Mongo shell\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb_terminal_online.php\nEnvironment Variables -\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js.html\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sql-comparison/\n\n"},"others/mentors-guide.html":{"url":"others/mentors-guide.html","title":"Mentors Guide","keywords":"","body":"Mentors Guide\nIndex\n\nIntroduction\nMain instructors  \nSupporting instructors\n\n\nGeneral information\nModule Structure  \nExample of a lesson structure\nExercises repositories in Github\nTools that we use\nKnow your students\n\n\nFeedback & Contributing\nOther links\n\nIntroduction\nAt MigraCode we believe, as we have always done, that finding professional programmers to deliver our course best prepares our students for professional life by giving them the most up to date knowledge and helping them build a network of developers for when they graduate.\nIn teachtogether.tech, you will find practical information to teach how to code.\nBasic information about our classes that instructors should know:\nMain instructors\n\nLessons structure\nCheck that you know the module and lessons structure\nYou know how to manage the exercises repositories on Github\n\n\nLessons contents and materials\nYou checked the Notes and extra materials for each lesson\nYou know what tools are using the students\nOnly for online classes, you read the Online classes manual\n\n\n\nSupporting instructors\nBasic information that supporting instructors should know:\n\nCheck that you know the module and lessons structure\nYou know what tools are using the students\nOnly for online classes, you read the Online classes manual\n\nGeneral information\nModule Structure\nEach module has 3 weeks lessons, and each lesson is divided as follows:\n\nWeekday (4h): explain topics through materials syllabus and presentations and coding, in every topic there are one or more exercises that you would give time to the students to do it, later you can show how to solve it\nHomework (20h): exercises students should complete between the Weekday and the Weekend to practice the new content. As a instructor you don't have to do anything, the Migracode's Education Team will help and push the students to have all exercises finished before the Weekend.\nWeekend (4h): is a day to practice, at the beginning we would do a recap and check together the homework, after it and with support, they have to do the exercises by their own.
