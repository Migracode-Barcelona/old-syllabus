## Node Recap

Javascript has evolved from the browser to be used in the backend. It does not need a framework as we saw in [week-13](../week-13/lesson.md), however a framework like Express allows us to develop faster.

### Documentation

When you are working with frameworks it is always helpful to use their documentation.

- [Express Documentation](https://expressjs.com)
- [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)

### Middleware

Middleware allow us to process requests to add functionalities that are not built in to Express, for example logging, authentication, etc.

> - Express Documentation: [Using Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
> - Video: [body-parser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlybue_yMQ) which makes it easier to work with POST requests and forms.

## Authentication

Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to the client requests. These are configured differently for each framework, and can range from basic configuration to very extensive for more complex use cases.

Simple example

```js
app.get("/", function (request, response) {
  res.send("hello world");
});
```

Sometimes you need to add user functionality for your website. Example using `express-session` for authentication

```js
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
    if (request.session.loggedin) {
        response.send('Welcome back, ' + request.session.username + '!');
    } else {
        response.send('Please login to view this page!');
    }
    response.end();
});
```

To understand express-session, we need to know first, what is a session and a cookie?

- Session: is a single interval of time in which the user is authenticated.
- Cookie: are used to collect identifying information about the user, such as Web surfing behavior or user preferences for a specific Web site, also are used to store user sessions. Depending on the management, Cookies are stored during a specified period of time, in the browser or in the hard drive

> - Read the [Basics on Authentication](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2017/01/08/web-security-session-cookies/) to understand better the process.

**Exercise 1:** Create a server with the following code. What is the code doing? Tip: remember the steps to create a server

```js
const express = require("express") 
const session = require('express-session') 
const app = express() 
    
// Port Number Setup 
var PORT = process.env.port || 3000 
   
// Session Setup 
app.use(session({ 
    // It holds the secret key for session 
    secret: 'Your_Secret_Key', 
    // Forces the session to be saved 
    // back to the session store 
    resave: true, 
    // Forces a session that is "uninitialized" 
    // to be saved to the store 
    saveUninitialized: true
})) 
   
app.get("/", function(req, res){ 
    // req.session.key = value 
    req.session.name = 'GeeksforGeeks'
    return res.send("Session Set") 
}) 
   
app.get("/session", function(req, res){ 
    var name = req.session.name 
    return res.send(name) 
    /*  To destroy session you can use 
        this function  
     req.session.destroy(function(error){ 
        console.log("Session Destroyed") 
    }) 
    */
}) 
    
app.listen(PORT, function(error){ 
    if(error) throw error 
    console.log("Server created Successfully on PORT :", PORT) 
}) 
```

> - Documentation: [express-session](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html)

**Exercise 2:** Create a server with the following code. What is the code doing? After executing it, go to the Inspector, and analize the request headers...Set-Cookie should be there!

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const session = require('express-session');
const app = express();
app.use(session({
  secret: 'secret',
  resave: true,
  cookie: {
    maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 365 * 1000
  }
}))
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.views) {
    req.session.views++;
  }
  else {
    req.session.views = 1;
  }
  res.send(`${req.session.views} views`);
})
app.listen(3000);
```

## Security

When you take your website to production there is a whole range of things to consider.

![HTTP vs HTTPS](../assets/http-vs-https.png)

Node has built in support for HTTPS, and once you have your own certificates you can use this feature. However sometimes when you deploy to `cloud` Platform Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers such as Heroku, they provide SSL and configure it for you automatically.

> - Read: [Heroku SSL](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl)

## Best Practices

Express have their own recommended [best practices page](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html)

### REST

REST is a convention of how to design your API, whether it is for your own frontend, or other frontends and clients.
