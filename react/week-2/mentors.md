## Notes for Mentors

### Handling Events

- Function references vs function calls is a very common source of confusion
  - It is worth recapping again to ensure that students really do understand it
- Passing event handler function references
  - The concept trips up a lot of students - will try to immediately call the function when passing to an event handler (e.g. `onClick={this.foo()})`
- Passing functions as props
  - This concept isn't really that much different from the section above, but passing across components does often confuse students

### Re-Rendering Components

- The goal of this section is to demonstrate React re-rendering but **without using state**
  - i.e. showing that React will call component functions again to get updated JSX after props/state changes
  - Teaching separately allows us to emphasise that setting state has 2 jobs: updating the state and triggering React to re-render
  - It is also convenient to (briefly) discuss how the virtual DOM is efficient
- Re-rendering demo
  - Focus on the `Counter` component primarily, in particular the `console.log`
  - The code in `index.js` is just a way of forcing a re-render without using state. But we don't really want students to learn the bad habits here (we want them to ultimately learn state), so they are hidden away.

### State

- This section takes a bit of a risk - it deliberately shows the wrong way trying to do state, then refactors to fix it
- Before fixing the problem, something to emphasise is the moment when we start using the virtual DOM for the first time
  - When we trigger a manual re-render to `ReactDOM.render()`
  - But we are updating the DOM here - we mentioned in lesson 1 that this was hard, and now we've got an easy way of updating it. This is the true power of React
  - The demo is not very impressive, so it's easy for the students to miss
- We cover the problems with using a global variable, so hopefully that is enough to prevent the students copy/pasting the wrong way
  - Ensure that you emphasise this is the wrong way to do state
- Demonstrate the app with multiple counters
  - Shows that each components remembers their own state separate to other components
- When to use props or state?
  - My rule of thumb: use props until you need it to change over time, then switch to state
- Container components
  - To be honest I kept this in here as a hold over from previous lessons
  - Arguably it's less relevant recently in React
  - If you're short on time then it can be skipped
