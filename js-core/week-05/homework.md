# Practice Day (Saturday)

## Playing computer I

1. You have to predict the output of this program without executing it.
2. What is printed to the console?

```js
const daysOfWeek = [
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
  "Saturday",
  "Sunday",
];

function workingDay(day) {
  return day + " is a working day";
}

function weekendDay(day) {
  return day + " is at the weekend!";
}

for (let i = 0; i < daysOfWeek.length; i++) {
  if (i < 5) {
    let day = workingDay(daysOfWeek[i]);
    console.log(day);
  } else {
    let day = weekendDay(daysOfWeek[i]);
    console.log(day);
  }
}
```

## Playing computer II

1. You have to predict the output of this program without executing it.
2. What is printed to the console?

```js
const a = 4;
const b = 8;

const multiplyNumbers = function (a, b) {
  return a * b;
};

const addNumbers = function (a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
};

for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
  if (i < 3) {
    const day = addNumbers(i, 2, a);
    console.log(day);
  } else {
    const day = multiplyNumbers(i, 4);
    console.log(day);
  }
}
```

## Playing computer III

1. Again, you have to predict the output of this program without executing it.
2. What is printed to the console?
3. What was difficult about this exercise?

```js
let x = 2;
let y = 4;
let a = 2;
let b = 20;

const f1 = function (a, b) {
  return a * b;
};

const f2 = function (a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
};

console.log(x);
x = 3;
y = f1(x, 2);
console.log(y);

for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
  a = a + 1;
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    const d = f2(i, y, a);
    console.log(d);
  } else {
    const e = f1(i, 2);
    console.log(e);
  }
}
```
