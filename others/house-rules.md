# House Rules

- **Whilst you're a student, arrive on time**. Lots of people are giving freely
  of their time and knowledge to make the class possible and giving up other
  commitments to be here. Respect that, and always be on time.

- **Leave our space cleaner and tidier than when we arrive**. We are hosted by
  generous folks who are offering their space (and time) to help us - the least
  we can do is to keep their space tidy and clean, and consider it our own.

- **Communication is key (and in English)**. Setup Slack on your phone and
  computer, and use it all the time to ask and provide help, enquire about the
  classes etc... Also, the classes help lots of the students (and volunteers!)
  to improve their English as a nice side effect, so even if you share a
  language with some of the participants, resist the temptation and speak in
  English!

- **Learn to find answers**. A big part of what we teach you is about
  researching and finding answers by yourself - get in the habit of Googling and
  finding answers to your questions.

- **Always be in control of the keyboard and mouse**. Don't let the mentors take
  control of your keyboard and mouse, don't let them type for you, ask for help
  but do things yourself!

- **Help each other**. As students, you're the most qualified to help each
  other, as you're going through the same journey of learning - offer and ask
  for help from your fellow students (helping someone else is also one of the
  best ways to improve your own skills)

- **We are a community**. This project is special (it's more than just a coding
  school) and it belongs to all of us: students, mentors, volunteers and friends
  of CYF. Embrace it like that, be proactive about helping it grow and succeed
  in all of its aspects.
